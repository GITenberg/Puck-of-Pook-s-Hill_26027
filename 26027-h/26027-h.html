          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The children were at the Theatre, acting to Three Cows as much as they could remember
            of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midsummer Night’s Dream</span></span>. Their father had made them a small
            play out of the big Shakespeare one, and they had rehearsed it with him and with their
            mother till they could say it by heart. They began where Nick Bottom the weaver comes
            out of the bushes with a donkey’s head on his shoulder, and finds Titania, Queen of the
            Fairies, asleep. Then they skipped to the part where Bottom asks three little fairies to
            scratch his head and bring him honey, and they ended where he falls asleep in Titania’s
            arms. Dan was Puck and Nick Bottom, as well as all three Fairies. He wore a pointy-eared
            cloth cap for Puck, and a paper donkey’s head out of a Christmas cracker—but it tore if
            you were not careful—for Bottom. Una was Titania, with a wreath of columbines and a
            foxglove wand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Theatre lay in a meadow called the Long Slip. A little mill-stream, carrying water
            to a mill two or three fields away, bent round one corner of it, and in the middle of
            the bend lay a large old fairy Ring of darkened grass, which was their stage. The
            mill-stream banks, overgrown with willow, hazel, and guelder rose made convenient places
            to wait in till your <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>turn came; and a grown-up who had
            seen it said that Shakespeare himself could not have imagined a more suitable setting
            for his play. They were not, of course, allowed to act on Midsummer Night itself, but
            they went down after tea on Midsummer Eve, when the shadows were growing, and they took
            their supper—hard-boiled eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in an envelope—with
            them. Three Cows had been milked and were grazing steadily with a tearing noise that one
            could hear all down the meadow; and the noise of the mill at work sounded like bare feet
            running on hard ground. A cuckoo sat on a gatepost singing his broken June tune,
            ‘cuckoo-cuk,’ while a busy kingfisher crossed from the mill-stream to the brook which
            ran on the other side of the meadow. Everything else was a sort of thick, sleepy
            stillness smelling of meadow-sweet and dry grass. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Their play went beautifully. Dan remembered all his parts—Puck, Bottom, and the three
            Fairies—and Una never forgot a word of Titania—not even the difficult piece where she
            tells the Fairies how to feed Bottom with ‘apricocks, ripe figs, and dewberries,’ and
            all the lines end in ‘ies.’ They were both so pleased that they acted it three times
            over from beginning to end before they sat down in the unthistly centre of the Ring to
            eat eggs and Bath Olivers. This was when they heard a whistle among the alders on the
            bank, and they jumped. </p>

            a grin that ran right across his freckled face. He shaded his forehead as though he were
            watching Quince, Snout, Bottom, and the others rehearsing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-corr"><span style="font-style: italic">Pyramus</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> and Thisbe</span></span>, and, in a voice as deep as Three Cows
            asking to be milked, he began: </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">‘What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">So near the cradle of our fairy Queen?’</div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He stopped, hollowed one hand round his ear, and, with a wicked twinkle in his eye,
            went on: </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">‘What a play toward? I’ll be auditor,</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.’</div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The children looked and gasped. The small thing—he was no taller than Dan’s
            shoulder—stepped quietly into the Ring. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’m rather out of practice,’ said he; ‘but that’s the way my part ought to be
            played.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still the children stared at him—from his dark blue cap, like a big columbine flower,
            to his bare, hairy feet. At last he laughed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Please don’t look like that. It isn’t <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></span> fault. What else
            could you expect?’ he said. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We didn’t expect any one,’ Dan answered, slowly. ‘This is our field.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Is it?’ said their visitor, sitting down. ‘Then what on Human Earth made you act <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midsummer Night’s Dream</span></span> three times over, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">on</span></span>

              Hill—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Puck’s Hill—Pook’s Hill! It’s as plain as the
            nose on my face.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He pointed to the bare, fern-covered slope of Pook’s Hill that runs up from the far
            side of the mill-stream to a dark wood. Beyond that wood the ground rises and rises for
            five hundred feet, till at last you climb out on the bare top of Beacon Hill, to look
            over the Pevensey Levels and the Channel and half the naked South Downs. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘By Oak, Ash, and Thorn!’ he cried, still laughing. ‘If this had happened a few
            hundred years ago you’d have had all the People of the Hills out like bees in June!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We didn’t know it was wrong,’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Wrong!’ The little fellow shook with laughter. ‘Indeed, it isn’t wrong. You’ve done
            something that Kings and Knights and Scholars in old days would have given their crowns
            and spurs and books to find out. If Merlin himself had helped you, you couldn’t have
            managed better! You’ve broken the Hills—you’ve broken the Hills! It hasn’t happened in
            a thousand years.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We—we didn’t mean to,’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Of course you didn’t! That’s just why you did it. Unluckily the Hills are empty now,
            and all the People of the Hills are gone. I’m the only one left. I’m Puck, the oldest
            Old Thing in England, very much at your service if—if you care to have anything to do
            with me. If you don’t, of course you’ve only to say so, and I’ll go.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He looked at the children and the children looked at him for quite half a minute. His
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>eyes did not twinkle any more. They were very kind,
            and there was the beginning of a good smile on his lips. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Una put out her hand. ‘Don’t go,’ she said. ‘We like you.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Have a Bath Oliver,’ said Dan, and he passed over the squashy envelope with the eggs. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘By Oak, Ash, and Thorn!’ cried Puck, taking off his blue cap, ‘I like you too.
            Sprinkle a little salt on the biscuit, Dan, and I’ll eat it with you. That’ll show you
            the sort of person I am. Some of us’—he went on, with his mouth full—<span class="tei tei-corr">‘couldn’t</span> abide Salt, or Horseshoes over a door, or Mountain-ash
            berries, or Running Water, or Cold Iron, or the sound of Church Bells. But I’m Puck!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He brushed the crumbs carefully from his doublet and shook hands. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We always said, Dan and I,’ Una stammered, ‘that if it ever happened we’d know
            ex-actly what to do; but—but now it seems all different somehow.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘She means meeting a fairy,’ said Dan. <span class="tei tei-corr">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span></span>
            never believed in ’em—not after I was six, anyhow.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I did,’ said Una. ‘At least, I sort of half believed till we learned “Farewell
            Rewards.” Do you know “Farewell Rewards and Fairies”?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Do you mean this?’ said Puck. He threw his big head back and began at the second

            over when the mill does not need it, and at the gnarled old white-thorn where Three Cows
            scratched their necks. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It’s all right,’ he said; and added, ‘I’m planting a lot of acorns this autumn too.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then aren’t you most awfully old?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Not old—fairly long-lived, as folk say hereabouts. Let me see—my friends used to

            made the Dewpond under Chanctonbury Ring.’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I was thinking—suppose we saved some of our porridge and put it in the attic for

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Schoolroom,’ said Dan, quickly, and Una flushed, because they had made a solemn
            treaty that summer not to call the schoolroom the nursery any more. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Bless your heart o’ gold!’ said Puck. ‘You’ll make a fine considering wench some
            market-day. I really don’t want you to put out a bowl for me; but if ever I need a bite,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He stretched himself at length on the dry grass, and the children stretched out beside

            Hobden, the hedger. He did not bother them with grown-up questions, or laugh at the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Have you a knife on you?’ he said at last. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan handed over his big one-bladed outdoor knife, and Puck began to carve out a piece
            of turf from the centre of the Ring. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What’s that for—Magic?’ said Una, as he pressed up the square of chocolate loam that
            cut like so much cheese. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘One of my little Magics,’ he answered, and cut another. ‘You see, I can’t let you
            into the Hills because the People of the Hills have gone; but if you care to take seizin
            from me, I may be able to show you something out of the common here on Human Earth. You
            certainly deserve it.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What’s taking seizin?’ said Dan, cautiously. </p>

            than twenty oaks. Let’s sit down again and think. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> can do that

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No. You talk about “the People of the Hills,” but you never say “fairies,”’ said Una.
            ‘I was wondering at that. Don’t you like it?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How would you like to be called “mortal” or “human being” all the time?’ said Puck;
            ‘or “son of Adam” or “daughter of Eve”?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I shouldn’t like it at all,’ said Dan. ‘That’s <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>how

            the Hills have never heard of—little buzzflies with butterfly wings and gauze
            petticoats, and shiny stars in their hair, and a wand like a schoolteacher’s cane for
            punishing bad boys and rewarding good ones. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> know ’em!’ </p>

            confused with that painty-winged, wand-waving, sugar-and-shake-your-head set of
            impostors? Butterfly wings, indeed! I’ve seen Sir Huon and a troop of his people setting
            off from Tintagel Castle for Hy-Brasil in the teeth of a sou’-westerly gale, with the
            spray flying all over the castle, and the Horses of the Hill wild with fright. Out
            they’d go in a lull, screaming like gulls, and back they’d be driven five good miles
            inland before they could come head to wind again. Butterfly-wings! It was Magic—Magic
            as black as Merlin could make it, and the whole sea was green fire and white foam with
            singing mermaids in it. And the Horses of the Hill picked their way from one wave to
            another by the lightning flashes! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></span> was how it was in the old
            days!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Splendid,’ said Dan, but Una shuddered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’m glad they’re gone, then; but what made the People of the Hills go away?’ Una
            asked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Different things. I’ll tell you one of them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>some
            day—the thing that made the biggest flit of any,’ said Puck. ‘But they didn’t all flit
            at once. They dropped off, one by one, through the centuries. Most of them were
            foreigners who couldn’t stand our climate. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></span> flitted early.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How early?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A couple of thousand years or more. The fact is they began as Gods. The Phœnicians
            brought some over when they came to buy tin; and the Gauls, and the Jutes, and the
            Danes, and the Frisians, and the Angles brought more when they landed. They were always
            landing in those days, or being driven back to their ships, and they always brought
            their Gods with them. England is a bad country for Gods. Now, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span>
            began as I mean to go on. A bowl of porridge, a dish of milk, and a little quiet fun
            with the country folk in the lanes was enough for me then, as it is now. I belong here,
            you see, and I have been mixed up with people all my days. But most of the others
            insisted on being Gods, and having temples, and altars, and priests, and sacrifices of
            their own.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘People burned in wicker baskets?’ said Dan. ‘Like Miss Blake tells us about?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘All sorts of sacrifices,’ said Puck. ‘If it wasn’t men, it was horses, or cattle, or
            pigs, or metheglin—that’s a sticky, sweet sort of beer. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> never
            liked it. They were a stiff-necked, extravagant set of idols, the Old Things. But what
            was the result? Men don’t like being sacrificed at the best of times; they don’t even
            like sacrificing their farm-horses. After a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>while men
            simply left the Old Things alone, and the roofs of their temples fell in, and the Old
            Things had to scuttle out and pick up a living as they could. Some of them took to
            hanging about trees, and hiding in graves and groaning o’ nights. If they groaned loud
            enough and long enough they might frighten a poor countryman into sacrificing a hen, or
            leaving a pound of butter for them. I remember one Goddess called Belisama. She became a
            common wet water-spirit somewhere in Lancashire. And there were hundreds of other
            friends of mine. First they were Gods. Then they were People of the Hills, and then they
            flitted to other places because they couldn’t get on with the English for one reason or
            another. There was only one Old Thing, I remember, who honestly worked for his living
            after he came down in the world. He was called Weland, and he was a smith to some Gods.
            I’ve forgotten their names, but he used to make them swords and spears. I think he
            claimed kin with Thor of the Scandinavians.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heroes of Asgard</span></span> Thor?’ said Una. She had been reading the
            book. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Perhaps,’ answered Puck. ‘None the less, when bad times came, he didn’t beg or steal.
            He worked; and I was lucky enough to be able to do him a good turn.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Tell us about it,’ said Dan. ‘I think I like hearing of Old Things.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They rearranged themselves comfortably, each chewing a grass stem. Puck propped
            himself on one strong arm and went on: </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Let’s think! I met Weland first on a No<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>vember
            afternoon in a sleet storm, on Pevensey Level——’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Pevensey? Over the hill, you mean?’ Dan pointed south. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes; but it was all marsh in those days, right up to Horsebridge and Hydeneye. I was
            on Beacon Hill—they called it Brunanburgh then—when I saw the pale flame that burning
            thatch makes, and I went down to look. Some pirates—I think they must have been Peofn’s
            men—were burning a village on the Levels, and Weland’s image—a big, black wooden thing
            with amber beads round its neck—lay in the bows of a black thirty-two-oar galley that
            they had just beached. Bitter cold it was! There were icicles hanging from her deck, and
            the oars were glazed over with ice, and there was ice on Weland’s lips. When he saw me
            he began a long chant in his own tongue, telling me how he was going to rule England,
            and how I should smell the smoke of his altars from Lincolnshire to the Isle of Wight.
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> didn’t care! I’d seen too many Gods charging into Old England
            to be upset about it. I let him sing himself out while his men were burning the village,
            and then I said (I don’t know what put it into my head), “Smith of the Gods,” I said,
            “the time comes when I shall meet you plying your trade for hire by the wayside.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did Weland say?’ said Una. ‘Was he angry?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He called me names and rolled his eyes, and I went away to wake up the people inland.
            But the pirates conquered the country, and for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>centuries Weland was a most important God. He had temples everywhere—from
            Lincolnshire to the Isle of Wight, as he said—and his sacrifices were simply
            scandalous. To do him justice, he preferred horses to men; but men <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">or</span></span> horses, I knew that presently he’d have to come down in the world—like the
            other Old Things. I gave him lots of time—I gave him about a thousand years—and at the
            end of ’em I went into one of his temples near Andover to see how he prospered. There
            was his altar, and there was his image, and there were his priests, and there were the
            congregation, and everybody seemed quite happy, except Weland and the priests. In the
            old days the congregation were unhappy until the priests had chosen their sacrifices;
            and so would <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> have been. When the service began a priest
            rushed out, dragged a man up to the altar, pretended to hit him on the head with a
            little gilt axe, and the man fell down and pretended to die. Then everybody shouted: “A
            sacrifice to Weland! A sacrifice to Weland!”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And the man wasn’t really dead?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Not a bit. All as much pretence as a dolls’ tea-party. Then they brought out a
            splendid white horse, and the priest cut some hair from its mane and tail and burned it
            on the altar, shouting, “A sacrifice!” That counted the same as if a man and a horse had
            been killed. I saw poor Weland’s face through the smoke, and I couldn’t help laughing.
            He looked so disgusted and so hungry, and all he had to satisfy himself was a horrid
            smell of burning hair. Just a dolls’ tea-party! </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I judged it better not to say anything then (’twouldn’t have been fair), and the next
            time I came to Andover, a few hundred years later, Weland and his temple were gone, and
            there was a Christian bishop in a Church there. None of the People of the Hills could
            tell me anything about him, and I supposed that he had left England.’ Puck turned; lay
            on the other elbow, and thought for a long time. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Let’s see,’ he said at last. ‘It must have been some few years later—a year or two
            before the Conquest, I think—that I came back to Pook’s Hill here, and one evening I
            heard old Hobden talking about Weland’s Ford.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘If you mean old Hobden the hedger, he’s only seventy-two. He told me so himself,’
            said Dan. ‘He’s a intimate friend of ours.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘You’re quite right,’ Puck replied. ‘I meant old Hobden’s ninth great-grandfather. He
            was a free man and burned charcoal hereabouts. I’ve known the family, father and son, so
            long that I get confused sometimes. Hob of the Dene was my Hobden’s name, and he lived
            at the Forge cottage. Of course, I pricked up my ears when I heard Weland mentioned, and
            I scuttled through the woods to the Ford just beyond Bog Wood yonder.’ He jerked his
            head westward, where the valley narrows between wooded hills and steep hop-fields. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why, that’s Willingford Bridge,’ said Una. ‘We go there for walks often. There’s a
            kingfisher there.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It was Weland’s Ford then, dear. A road led down to it from the Beacon on the top of
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the hill—a shocking bad road it was—and all the
            hillside was thick, thick oak-forest, with deer in it. There was no trace of Weland, but
            presently I saw a fat old farmer riding down from the Beacon under the greenwood tree.
            His horse had cast a shoe in the clay, and when he came to the Ford he dismounted, took
            a penny out of his purse, laid it on a stone, tied the old horse to an oak, and called
            out: “Smith, Smith, here is work for you!” Then he sat down and went to sleep. You can
            imagine how <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> felt when I saw a white-bearded, bent old
            blacksmith in a leather apron creep out from behind the oak and begin to shoe the horse.
            It was Weland himself. I was so astonished that I jumped out and said: “What on Human
            Earth are you doing here, Weland?”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Poor Weland!’ sighed Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He pushed the long hair back from his forehead (he didn’t recognise me at first).
            Then he said: “<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span></span> ought to know. You foretold it, Old Thing. I’m
            shoeing horses for hire. I’m not even Weland now,” he said. “They call me
            Wayland-Smith.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Poor chap!’ said Dan. ‘What did you say?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What could I say? He looked up, with the horse’s foot on his lap, and he said,
            smiling, “I remember the time when I wouldn’t have accepted this old bag of bones as a
            sacrifice, and now I’m glad enough to shoe him for a penny.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Isn’t there any way for you to get back to Valhalla, or wherever you come from?” I
            said. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I’m afraid not,” he said, rasping away at the hoof. He had a wonderful touch with
            horses. The old beast was whinnying on his shoulder. “You may remember that I was not a
            gentle God in my Day and my Time and my Power. I shall never be released till some human
            being truly wishes me well.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Surely,” said I, “the farmer can’t do less than that. You’re shoeing the horse all
            round for him.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Yes,” said he, “and my nails will hold a shoe from one full moon to the next. But
            farmers and Weald Clay,” said he, “are both uncommon cold and sour.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Would you believe it, that when that farmer woke and found his horse shod he rode
            away without one word of thanks? I was so angry that I wheeled his horse right round and
            walked him back three miles to the Beacon just to teach the old sinner politeness.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Were you invisible?’ said Una. Puck nodded, gravely. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The Beacon was always laid in those days ready to light, in case the French landed at
            Pevensey; and I walked the horse about and about it that lee-long summer night. The
            farmer thought he was bewitched—well, he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span>, of course—and
            began to pray and shout. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> didn’t care! I was as good a Christian
            as he any fair-day in the County, and about four o’clock in the morning a young novice
            came along from the monastery that used to stand on the top of Beacon hill.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What’s a novice?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It really means a man who is beginning to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be a monk,
            but in those days people sent their sons to a monastery just the same as a school. This
            young fellow had been to a monastery in France for a few months every year, and he was
            finishing his studies in the monastery close to his home here. Hugh was his name, and he
            had got up to go fishing hereabouts. His people owned all this valley. Hugh heard the
            farmer shouting, and asked him what in the world he meant. The old man spun him a
            wonderful tale about fairies and goblins and witches; and I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></span>
            he hadn’t seen a thing except rabbits and red deer all that night. (The People of the
            Hills are like otters—they don’t show except when they choose.) But the novice wasn’t a
            fool. He looked down at the horse’s feet, and saw the new shoes fastened as only Weland
            knew how to fasten ’em. (Weland had a way of turning down the nails that folks called
            the Smith’s Clinch.) </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“H’m!” said the novice. “Where did you get your horse shod?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The farmer wouldn’t tell him at first, because the priests never liked their people
            to have any dealings with the Old Things. At last he confessed that the Smith had done
            it. “What did you pay him?” said the novice. “Penny,” said the farmer, very sulkily.
            “That’s less than a Christian would have charged,” said the novice. “I hope you threw a
            ‘Thank you’ into the bargain.” “No,” said the farmer; “Wayland-Smith’s a heathen.”
            “Heathen or no heathen,” said the novice, “you took his help, and where you get <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>help there you must give thanks.” “What?” said the
            farmer—he was in a furious temper because I was walking the old horse in circles all
            this time—“What, you young jackanapes?” said he. “Then by your reasoning I ought to say
            ‘Thank you’ to Satan if he helped me?” “Don’t roll about up there splitting reasons with
            me,” said the novice. “Come back to the Ford and thank the Smith, or you’ll be sorry.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Back the farmer had to go! I led the horse, though no one saw me, and the novice
            walked beside us, his gown swishing through the shiny dew and his fishing-rod across his
            shoulders spearwise. When we reached the Ford again—it was five o’clock and misty still
            under the oaks—the farmer simply wouldn’t say “Thank you.” He said he’d tell the Abbot
            that the novice wanted him to worship heathen gods. Then Hugh the novice lost his
            temper. He just cried, “Out!” put his arm under the farmer’s fat leg, and heaved him
            from his saddle on to the turf, and before he could rise he caught him by the back of
            the neck and shook him like a rat till the farmer growled, “Thank you, Wayland-Smith.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Did Weland see all this?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, yes, and he shouted his old war-cry when the farmer thudded on to the ground. He
            was delighted. Then the novice turned to the oak and said, “Ho! Smith of the Gods, I am
            ashamed of this rude farmer; but for all you have done in kindness and charity to him
            and to others of our people, I thank you and wish you well.” Then he picked up his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fishing-rod—it looked more like a tall spear than
            ever—and tramped off down your valley.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And what did poor Weland do?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He laughed and cried with joy, because he had been released at last, and could go
            away. But he was an honest Old Thing. He had worked for his living and he paid his debts
            before he left. “I shall give that novice a gift,” said Weland. “A gift that shall do
            him good the wide world over, and Old England after him. Blow up my fire, Old Thing,
            while I get the iron for my last task.” Then he made a sword—a dark grey, wavy-lined
            sword—and I blew the fire while he hammered. By Oak, Ash, and Thorn, I tell you, Weland
            was a Smith of the Gods! He cooled that sword in running water twice, and the third time
            he cooled it in the evening dew, and he laid it out in the moonlight and said Runes
            (that’s charms) over it, and he carved Runes of Prophecy on the blade. “Old Thing,” he
            said to me, wiping his forehead, “this is the best blade that Weland ever made. Even the
            user will never know how good it is. Come to the monastery.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We went to the dormitory where the monks slept. We saw the novice fast asleep in his
            cot, and Weland put the sword into his hand, and I remember the young fellow gripped it
            in his sleep. Then Weland strode as far as he dared into the Chapel and threw down all
            his shoeing-tools—his hammer, and pincers, and rasps—to show that he had done with
            them for ever. It sounded like suits of armour falling, and the sleepy monks ran in, for
            they thought the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>monastery had been attacked by the
            French. The novice came first of all, waving his new sword and shouting Saxon
            battle-cries. When they saw the shoeing-tools they were very bewildered, till the novice
            asked leave to speak, and told what he had done to the farmer, and what he had said to
            Wayland-Smith, and how, though the dormitory light was burning, he had found the
            wonderful rune-carved sword in his cot. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The Abbot shook his head at first, and then he laughed and said to the novice: “Son
            Hugh, it needed no sign from a heathen God to show me that you will never be a monk.
            Take your sword, and keep your sword, and go with your sword, and be as gentle as you
            are strong and courteous. We will hang up the Smith’s tools before the Altar,” he said,
            “because, whatever the Smith of the Gods may have been in the old days, we know that he
            worked honestly for his living and made gifts to Mother Church.” Then they went to bed
            again, all except the novice, and he sat up in the garth playing with his sword. Then
            Weland said to me by the stables: “Farewell, Old Thing; you had the right of it. You saw
            me come to England, and you see me go. Farewell!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘With that he strode down the hill to the corner of the Great Woods—Woods Corner, you
            call it now—to the very place where he had first landed—and I heard him moving through
            the thickets towards Horsebridge for a little, and then he was gone. That was how it
            happened. I saw it.’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Puck looked down the meadow that lay all quiet and cool in the shadow of Pook’s Hill.
            A corncrake jarred in a hay-field near by, and the small trouts of the brook began to
            jump. A big white moth flew unsteadily from the alders and flapped round the children’s
            heads, and the least little haze of water-mist rose from the brook. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Do you really want to know?’ Puck said. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We do,’ cried the children. ‘Awfully!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Very good. I promised you that you shall see What you shall see, and you shall hear
            What you shall hear, though It shall have happened three thousand year; but just now it
            seems to me that, unless you go back to the house, people will be looking for you. I’ll
            walk with you as far as the gate.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Will you be here when we come again?’ they asked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Surely, sure-ly,’ said Puck. ‘I’ve been here some time already. One minute first,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They were fishing, a few days later, in the bed of the brook that for centuries had
            cut deep into the soft valley soil. The trees closing overhead made long tunnels through
            which the sunshine worked in blobs and patches. Down in the tunnels were bars of sand
            and gravel, old roots and trunks covered with moss or painted red by the irony water;
            foxgloves growing lean and pale towards the light; clumps of fern and thirsty shy
            flowers who could not live away from moisture and shade. In the pools you could see the
            wave thrown up by the trouts as they charged hither and yon, and the pools were joined
            to each other—except in flood time, when all was one brown rush—by sheets of thin
            broken water that poured themselves chuckling round the darkness of the next bend. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This was one of the children’s most secret hunting-grounds, and their particular
            friend, old Hobden the hedger, had shown them how to use it. Except for the click of a
            rod hitting a low willow, or a switch and tussle among the young ash-leaves as a line
            hung up for the minute, nobody in the hot pasture could have guessed what game was going
            on among the trouts below the banks. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We’s got half-a-dozen,’ said Dan, after a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>warm, wet
            hour. ‘I vote we go up to Stone Bay and try Long Pool.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Una nodded—most of her talk was by nods—and they crept from the gloom of the tunnels
            towards the tiny weir that turns the brook into the mill-stream. Here the banks are low
            and bare, and the glare of the afternoon sun on the Long Pool below the weir makes your
            eyes ache. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When they were in the open they nearly fell down with astonishment. A huge grey horse,
            whose tail-hairs crinkled the glassy water, was drinking in the pool, and the ripples
            about his muzzle flashed like melted gold. On his back sat an old, white-haired man
            dressed in a loose glimmery gown of chain-mail. He was bareheaded, and a nut-shaped iron
            helmet hung at his saddle-bow. His reins were of red leather five or six inches deep,
            scalloped at the edges, and his high padded saddle with its red girths was held fore and
            aft by a red leather breastband and crupper. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Look!’ said Una, as though Dan were not staring his very eyes out. ‘It’s like the
            picture in your room—“Sir Isumbras at the Ford.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The rider turned towards them, and his thin, long face was just as sweet and gentle as
            that of the knight who carries the children in that picture. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They should be here now, Sir Richard,’ said Puck’s deep voice among the willow-herb. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They are here,’ the knight said, and he smiled at Dan with the string of trouts in
            his hand. ‘There seems no great change in boys since mine fished this water.’ </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span>
          <a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘If your horse has drunk, we shall be more at ease in the Ring,’ said Puck; and he
            nodded to the children as though he had never magicked away their memories the week
            before. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The great horse turned and hoisted himself into the pasture with a kick and a scramble
            that tore the clods down rattling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Your pardon!’ said Sir Richard to Dan. ‘When these lands were mine, I never loved
            that mounted men should cross the brook except by the paved ford. But my Swallow here
            was thirsty, and I wished to meet you.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We’re very glad you’ve come, sir,’ said Dan. ‘It doesn’t matter in the least about
            the banks.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He trotted across the pasture on the sword-side of the mighty horse, and it was a
            mighty iron-handled sword that swung from Sir Richard’s belt. Una walked behind with
            Puck. She remembered everything now. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’m sorry about the Leaves,’ he said, ‘but it would never have done if you had gone
            home and told, would it?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I s’pose not,’ Una answered. ‘But you said that all the fair—People of the Hills had
            left England.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So they have; but I told you that you should come and go and look and know, didn’t I?
            The knight isn’t a fairy. He’s Sir Richard Dalyngridge, a very old friend of mine. He
            came over with William the Conqueror, and he wants to see you particularly.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What for?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘On account of your great wisdom and learning,’ Puck replied, without a twinkle. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span>
          <a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Us?’ said Una. ‘Why, I don’t know my Nine Times—not to say it dodging; and Dan makes
            the most <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">awful</span></span> mess of fractions. He can’t mean <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></span>!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Una!’ Dan called back. ‘Sir Richard says he is going to tell what happened to
            Weland’s sword. He’s got it. Isn’t it splendid?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay—nay,’ said Sir Richard, dismounting as they reached the Ring, in the bend of the
            mill-stream bank. ‘It is you that must tell me, for I hear the youngest child in our
            England to-day is as wise as our wisest clerk.’ He slipped the bit out of Swallow’s
            mouth, dropped the ruby-red reins over his head, and the wise horse moved off to graze. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sir Richard (they noticed he limped a little) unslung his great sword. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That’s it,’ Dan whispered to Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘This is the sword that Brother Hugh had from Wayland-Smith,’ Sir Richard said. ‘Once
            he gave it to me, but I would not take it; but at the last it became mine after such a
            fight as never christened man fought. See!’ He half drew it from its sheath and turned
            it before them. On either side just below the handle, where the Runic letters shivered
            as though they were alive, were two deep gouges in the dull, deadly steel. ‘Now, what
            Thing made those?’ said he. ‘I know not, but you, perhaps, can say.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Tell them all the tale, Sir Richard,’ said Puck. ‘It concerns their land somewhat.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes, from the very beginning,’ Una pleaded, for the knight’s good face and the smile
            on it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more than ever reminded her of ‘Sir Isumbras at
            the Ford.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They settled down to listen, Sir Richard bare-headed to the sunshine, dandling the
            sword in both hands, while the grey horse cropped outside the Ring, and the helmet on
            the saddle-bow clinged softly each time he jerked his head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘From the beginning, then,’ Sir Richard said, ‘since it concerns your land, I will
            tell the tale. When our Duke came out of Normandy to take his England, great knights
            (have ye heard?) came and strove hard to serve the Duke, because he promised them lands
            here, and small knights followed the great ones. My folk in Normandy were poor; but a
            great knight, Engerrard of the Eagle—Engenulf De Aquila—who was kin to my father,
            followed the Earl of Mortain, who followed William the Duke, and I followed De Aquila.
            Yes, with thirty men-at-arms out of my father’s house and a new sword, I set out to
            conquer England three days after I was made knight. I did not then know that England
            would conquer me. We went up to Santlache with the rest—a very great host of us.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Does that mean the Battle of Hastings—Ten Sixty-Six?’ Una whispered, and Puck
            nodded, so as not to interrupt. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘At Santlache, over the hill yonder’—he pointed south-eastward towards Fairlight—‘we
            found Harold’s men. We fought. At the day’s end they ran. My men went with De Aquila’s
            to chase and plunder, and in that chase Engerrard of the Eagle was slain, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his son Gilbert took his banner and his men forward. This
            I did not know till after, for Swallow here was cut in the flank, so I stayed to wash
            the wound at a brook by a thorn. There a single Saxon cried out to me in French, and we
            fought together. I should have known his voice, but we fought together. For a long time
            neither had any advantage, till by pure ill-fortune his foot slipped and his sword flew
            from his hand. Now I had but newly been made knight, and wished, above all, to be
            courteous and fameworthy, so I forebore to strike and bade him get his sword again. “A
            plague on my sword,” said he. “It has lost me my first fight. You have spared my life.
            Take my sword.” He held it out to me, but as I stretched my hand the sword groaned like
            a stricken man, and I leaped back crying, “Sorcery!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> [The children looked at the sword as though it might speak again.] </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Suddenly a clump of Saxons ran out upon me and, seeing a Norman alone, would have
            killed me, but my Saxon cried out that I was his prisoner, and beat them off. Thus, see
            you, he saved my life. He put me on my horse and led me through the woods ten long miles
            to this valley.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘To here, d’you mean?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘To this very valley. We came in by the Lower Ford under the King’s Hill yonder’—he
            pointed eastward where the valley widens. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And was that Saxon Hugh the novice?’ Dan asked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes, and more than that. He had been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for three years
            at the monastery at Bec by Rouen, where’—Sir Richard chuckled—‘the Abbot Herluin would
            not suffer me to remain.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why wouldn’t he?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Because I rode my horse into the refectory, when the scholars were at meat, to show
            the Saxon boys we Normans were not afraid of an abbot. It was that very Saxon Hugh
            tempted me to do it, and we had not met since that day. I thought I knew his voice even
            inside my helmet, and, for all that our Lords fought, we each rejoiced we had not slain
            the other. He walked by my side, and he told me how a Heathen God, as he believed, had
            given him his sword, but he said he had never heard it sing before. I remember I warned
            him to beware of sorcery and quick enchantments.’ Sir Richard smiled to himself. ‘I was
            very young—very young! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When we came to his house here we had almost forgotten that we had been at blows. It
            was near midnight, and the Great Hall was full of men and women waiting news. There I
            first saw his sister, the Lady Ælueva, of whom he had spoken to us in France. She cried
            out fiercely at me, and would have had me hanged in that hour, but her brother said that
            I had spared his life—he said not how he saved mine from his Saxons—and that our Duke
            had won the day; and even while they wrangled over my poor body, of a sudden he fell
            down in a swoon from his wounds. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“This is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thy fault</span></span>,” said the Lady Ælueva to me, and she
            kneeled above him and called for wine and cloths. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span>
          <a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“If I had known,” I answered, “he should have ridden and I walked. But he set me on
            my horse; he made no complaint; he walked beside me and spoke merrily throughout. I pray
            I have done him no harm.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Thou hast need to pray,” she said, catching up her underlip. “If he dies, thou shalt
            hang!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They bore off Hugh to his chamber; but three tall men of the house bound me and set
            me under the beam of the Great Hall with a rope round my neck. The end of the rope they
            flung over the beam, and they sat them down by the fire to wait word whether Hugh lived
            or died. They cracked nuts with their knife-hilts the while.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And how did you feel?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Very weary; but I did heartily pray for my schoolmate Hugh his health. About noon I
            heard horses in the valley, and the three men loosed my ropes and fled out, and De
            Aquila’s men rode up. Gilbert de Aquila came with them, for it was his boast that, like
            his father, he forgot no man that served him. He was little, like his father, but
            terrible, with a nose like an eagle’s nose and yellow eyes like an eagle. He rode tall
            war-horses—roans, which he bred himself—and he could never abide to be helped into the
            saddle. He saw the rope hanging from the beam and laughed, and his men laughed, for I
            was too stiff to rise. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“This is poor entertainment for a Norman knight,” he said, “but, such as it is, let
            us be grateful. Show me, boy, to whom thou <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>owest most,
            and we will pay them out of hand.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did he mean? To kill ’em?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Assuredly. But I looked at the Lady Ælueva where she stood among her maids, and her
            brother beside her. De Aquila’s men had driven them all into the Great Hall.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Was she pretty?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘In all my life I had never seen woman fit to strew rushes before my Lady Ælueva,’ the
            knight replied, quite simply and quietly. ‘As I looked at her I thought I might save her
            and her house by a jest. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Seeing that I came somewhat hastily and without warning,” said I to De Aquila, “I
            have no fault to find with the courtesy that these Saxons have shown me.” But my voice
            shook. It is—it was not good to jest with that little man. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘All were silent awhile, till De Aquila laughed. “Look, men—a miracle!” said he. “The
            fight is scarce sped, my father is not yet buried, and here we find our youngest knight
            already set down in his Manor, while his Saxons—ye can see it in their fat faces—have
            paid him homage and service! By the Saints,” he said, rubbing his nose, “I never thought
            England would be so easy won! Surely I can do no less than give the lad what he has
            taken. This Manor shall be thine, boy,” he said, “till I come again, or till thou art
            slain. Now, mount, men, and ride. We follow our Duke into Kent to make him King of
            England.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He drew me with him to the door while <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they brought
            his horse—a lean roan, taller than my Swallow here, but not so well girthed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Hark to me,” he said, fretting with his great war-gloves. “I have given thee this
            Manor, which is a Saxon hornets’ nest, and I think thou wilt be slain in a month—as my
            father was slain. Yet if thou canst keep the roof on the hall, the thatch on the barn,
            and the plough in the furrow till I come back, thou shalt hold the Manor from me; for
            the Duke has promised our Earl Mortain all the lands by Pevensey, and Mortain will give
            me of them what he would have given my father. God knows if thou or I shall live till
            England is won; but remember, boy, that here and now fighting is foolishness and”—he
            reached for the reins—“craft and cunning is all.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Alas, I have no cunning,” said I. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Not yet,” said he, hopping abroad, foot in stirrup, and poking his horse in the
            belly with his toe. “Not yet, but I think thou hast a good teacher. Farewell! Hold the
            Manor and live. Lose the Manor and hang,” he said, and spurred out, his shield-straps
            squeaking behind him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So, children, here was I, little more than a boy, and Santlache fight not two days
            old, left alone with my thirty men-at-arms, in a land I knew not, among a people whose
            tongue I could not speak, to hold down the land which I had taken from them.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And that was here at home?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes, here. See! From the Upper Ford, Weland’s Ford, to the Lower Ford, by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Belle Allée, west and east it ran half a league. From the
            Beacon of Brunanburgh behind us here, south and north it ran a full league—and all the
            woods were full of broken men from Santlache, Saxon thieves, Norman plunderers, robbers,
            and deerstealers. A hornets’ nest indeed! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When De Aquila had gone, Hugh would have thanked me for saving their lives; but Lady
            Ælueva said that I had done it only for the sake of receiving the Manor. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“How could I know that De Aquila would give it me?” I said. “If I had told him I had
            spent my night in your halter he would have burned the place twice over by now.” </p>

            have seen his house burned thrice over before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> would have made
            terms.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“But it was a woman,” I said; and I laughed and she wept and said that I mocked her
            in her captivity. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Lady,” said I, “there is no captive in this valley except one, and he is not a
            Saxon.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘At this she cried that I was a Norman thief, who came with false, sweet words, having
            intended from the first to turn her out in the fields to beg her bread. Into the fields!
            She had never seen the face of war! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I was angry, and answered, “This much at least I can disprove, for I swear”—and on
            my sword-hilt I swore it in that place—“I swear I will never set foot in the Great Hall
            till the Lady Ælueva herself shall <span class="tei tei-corr">summon</span> me there.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘She went away, saying nothing, and I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>walked out, and
            Hugh limped after me, whistling dolorously (that is a custom of the English), and we
            came upon the three Saxons that had bound me. They were now bound by my men-at-arms, and
            behind them stood some fifty stark and sullen churls of the House and the Manor, waiting
            to see what should fall. We heard De Aquila’s trumpets blow thin through the woods
            Kentward. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Shall we hang these?” said my men. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Then my churls will fight,” said Hugh, beneath his breath; but I bade him ask the
            three what mercy they hoped for. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“None,” said they all. “She bade us hang thee if our master died. And we would have
            hanged thee. There is no more to it.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘As I stood doubting a woman ran down from the oak wood above the King’s Hill yonder,
            and cried out that some Normans were driving off the swine there. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Norman or Saxon,” said I, “we must beat them back, or they will rob us every day.
            Out at them with any arms ye have!” So I loosed those three carles and we ran together,
            my men-at-arms and the Saxons with bills and bows which they had hidden in the thatch of
            their huts, and Hugh led them. Half-way up the King’s Hill we found a false fellow from
            Picardy—a sutler that sold wine in the Duke’s camp—with a dead knight’s shield on his
            arm, a stolen horse under him, and some ten or twelve wastrels at his tail, all cutting
            and slashing at the pigs. We beat them off, and saved our pork. One hundred and sev<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enty pigs we saved in that great battle.’ Sir Richard
            laughed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That, then, was our first work together, and I bade Hugh tell his folk that so would
            I deal with any man, knight or churl, Norman or Saxon, who stole as much as one egg from
            our valley. Said he to me, riding home: “Thou hast gone far to conquer England this
            evening.” I answered: “England must be thine and mine, then. Help me, Hugh, to deal
            aright with this people. Make them to know that if they slay me De Aquila will surely
            send to slay them, and he will put a worse man in my place.” “That may well be true,”
            said he, and gave me his hand. “Better the devil we know than the devil we know not,
            till we can pack you Normans home.” And so, too, said his Saxons; and they laughed as we
            drove the pigs downhill. But I think some of them, even then, began not to hate me.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I like Brother Hugh,’ said Una, softly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Beyond question he was the most perfect, courteous, valiant, tender, and wise knight
            that ever drew breath,’ said Richard, caressing the sword. ‘He hung up his sword—this
            sword—on the wall of the Great Hall, because he said it was fairly mine, and never he
            took it down till De Aquila returned, as I shall presently show. For three months his
            men and mine guarded the valley, till all robbers and nightwalkers learned there was
            nothing to get from us save hard tack and a hanging. Side by side we fought against all
            who came—thrice a week sometimes we fought—against thieves <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and landless knights looking for good manors. Then we were in some peace,
            and I made shift by Hugh’s help to govern the valley—for all this valley of yours was
            my Manor—as a knight should. I kept the roof on the hall and the thatch on the barn,
            but.... The English are a bold people. His Saxons would laugh and jest with Hugh, and
            Hugh with them, and—this was marvellous to me—if even the meanest of them said that
            such and such a thing was the Custom of the Manor, then straightway would Hugh and such
            old men of the Manor as might be near forsake everything else to debate the matter—I
            have seen them stop the mill with the corn half ground—and if the custom or usage were
            proven to be as it was said, why, that was the end of it, even though it were flat
            against Hugh, his wish and command. Wonderful!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Aye,’ said Puck, breaking in for the first time. ‘The Custom of Old England was here
            before your Norman knights came, and it outlasted them, though they fought against it
            cruel.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Not I,’ said Richard. ‘I let the Saxons go their stubborn way, but when my own
            men-at-arms, Normans not six months in England, stood up and told me what was the custom
            of the country, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></span> I was angry. Ah, good days! Ah, wonderful
            people! And I loved them all.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The knight lifted his arms as though he would hug the whole dear valley, and Swallow,
            hearing the chink of his chain-mail, looked up and whinnied softly. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘At last,’ he went on, ‘after a year of striving and contriving and some little
            driving, De Aquila came to the valley, alone and without warning. I saw him first at the
            Lower Ford, with a swine-herd’s brat on his saddle-bow. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“There is no need for thee to give any account of thy stewardship,” said he. “I have
            it all from the child here.” And he told me how the young thing had stopped his tall
            horse at the Ford, by waving of a branch, and crying that the way was barred. “And if
            one bold, bare babe be enough to guard the Ford in these days, thou hast done well,”
            said he, and puffed and wiped his head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He pinched the child’s cheek, and looked at our cattle in the flat by the brook. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Both fat,” said he, rubbing his nose. “This is craft and cunning such as I love.
            What did I tell thee when I rode away, boy?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Hold the Manor or hang,” said I. I had never forgotten it. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“True. And thou hast held.” He clambered from his saddle and with sword’s point cut
            out a turf from the bank and gave it me where I kneeled.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan looked at Una, and Una looked at Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That’s seizin,’ said Puck, in a whisper. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Now thou art lawfully seized of the Manor, Sir Richard,” said he—’twas the first
            time he ever called me that—“thou and thy heirs for ever. This must serve till the
            King’s clerks write out thy title on a parchment. England is all ours—if we can hold
            it.” </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span>
          <a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What service shall I pay?” I asked, and I remember I was proud beyond words. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Knight’s fee, boy, knight’s fee!” said he, hopping round his horse on one foot.
            (Have I said he was little, and could not endure to be helped to his saddle?) “Six
            mounted men or twelve archers thou shalt send me whenever I call for them, and—where
            got you that corn?” said he, for it was near harvest, and our corn stood well. “I have
            never seen such bright straw. Send me three bags of the same seed yearly, and
            furthermore, in memory of our last meeting—with the rope round thy neck—entertain me
            and my men for two days of each year in the Great Hall of thy Manor.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Alas!” said I, “then my Manor is already forfeit. I am under vow not to enter the
            Great Hall.” And I told him what I had sworn to the Lady Ælueva.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And hadn’t you ever been into the house since?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Never,’ Sir Richard answered smiling. ‘I had made me a little hut of wood up the
            hill, and there I did justice and slept.... De Aquila wheeled aside, and his shield
            shook on his back. “No matter, boy,” said he. “I will remit the homage for a year.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He meant Sir Richard needn’t give him dinner there the first year,’ Puck explained. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘De Aquila stayed with me in the hut and Hugh, who could read and write and cast
            accounts, showed him the roll of the Manor, in which were written all the names of our
            fields and men, and he asked a thousand questions touching the land, the timber, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>grazing, the mill, and the fish-ponds, and the worth of
            every man in the valley. But never he named the Lady Ælueva’s name, nor went he near the
            Great Hall. By night he drank with us in the hut. Yes, he sat on the straw like an eagle
            ruffled in her feathers, his yellow eyes rolling above the cup, and he pounced in his
            talk like an eagle, swooping from one thing to another, but always binding fast. Yes; he
            would lie still awhile, and then rustle in the straw, and speak sometimes as though he
            were King William himself, and anon he would speak in parables and tales, and if at once
            we saw not his meaning he would yerk us in the ribs with his scabbarded sword. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Look you, boys,” said he, “I am born out of my due time. Five hundred years ago I
            would have made all England such an England as neither Dane, Saxon, nor Norman should
            have conquered. Five hundred years hence I should have been such a councillor to Kings
            as the world hath never dreamed of. ’Tis all here,” said he, tapping his big head, “but
            it hath no play in this black age. Now Hugh here is a better man than thou art,
            Richard.” He had made his voice harsh and croaking, like a raven’s. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Truth,” said I. “But for Hugh, his help and patience and long-suffering, I could
            never have kept the Manor.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Nor thy life either,” said De Aquila. “Hugh has saved thee not once, but a hundred
            times. Be still, Hugh!” he said. “Dost thou know, Richard, why Hugh slept, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>why he still sleeps, among thy Norman men-at-arms?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“To be near me,” said I, for I thought this was truth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Fool!” said De Aquila. “It is because his Saxons have begged him to rise against
            thee, and to sweep every Norman out of the valley. No matter how I know. It is truth.
            Therefore Hugh hath made himself an hostage for thy life, well knowing that if any harm
            befell thee from his Saxons thy Normans would slay him without remedy. And this his
            Saxons know. It is true, Hugh?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“In some sort,” said Hugh, shamefacedly; “at least, it was true half a year ago. My
            Saxons would not harm Richard now. I think they know him; but I judged it best to make
            sure.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Look, children, what that man had done—and I had never guessed it! Night after night
            had he lain down among my men-at-arms, knowing that if one Saxon had lifted knife
            against me his life would have answered for mine. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Yes,” said De Aquila. “And he is a swordless man.” He pointed to Hugh’s belt, for
            Hugh had put away his sword—did I tell you?—the day after it flew from his hand at
            Santlache. He carried only the short knife and the long-bow. “Swordless and landless art
            thou, Hugh; and they call thee kin to Earl Godwin.” (Hugh was indeed of Godwin’s blood.)
            “The Manor that was thine was given to this boy and to his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>children for ever. Sit up and beg, for he can turn thee out like a dog,
            Hugh!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Hugh said nothing, but I heard his teeth grind, and I bade De Aquila, my own
            overlord, hold his peace, or I would stuff his words down his throat. Then De Aquila
            laughed till the tears ran down his face. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I warned the King,” said he, “what would come of giving England to us Norman
            thieves. Here art thou, Richard, less than two days confirmed in thy Manor, and already
            thou hast risen against thy overlord. What shall <span class="tei tei-corr">we do</span> to him, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sir</span></span>
            Hugh?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I am a swordless man,” said Hugh. “Do not jest with me,” and he laid his head on his
            knees and groaned. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“The greater fool thou,” said De Aquila, and all his voice changed; “for I have given
            thee the Manor of Dallington up the hill this half-hour since,” and he yerked at Hugh
            with his scabbard across the straw. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“To me?” said Hugh. “I am a Saxon, and, except that I love Richard here, I have not
            sworn fealty to any Norman.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“In God’s good time, which because of my sins I shall not live to see, there will be
            neither Saxon nor Norman in England,” said De Aquila. “If I know men, thou art more
            faithful unsworn than a score of Normans I could name. Take Dallington, and join Sir
            Richard to fight me to-morrow, if it please thee!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Nay,” said Hugh. “I am no child. Where I take a gift, there I render service”; and
            he put his hands between De Aquila’s, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and swore to be
            faithful, and, as I remember, I kissed him, and De Aquila kissed us both. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We sat afterwards outside the hut while the sun rose, and De Aquila marked our churls
            going to their work in the fields, and talked of holy things, and how we should govern
            our Manors in time to come, and of hunting and of horse-breeding, and of the King’s
            wisdom and unwisdom; for he spoke to us as though we were in all sorts now his brothers.
            Anon a churl stole up to me—he was one of the three I had not hanged a year ago—and he
            bellowed—which is the Saxon for whispering—that the Lady Ælueva would speak to me at
            the Great House. She walked abroad daily in the Manor, and it was her custom to send me
            word whither she went, that I might set an archer or two behind and in front to guard
            her. Very often I myself lay up in the woods and watched on her also. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I went swiftly, and as I passed the great door it opened from within, and there stood
            my Lady Ælueva, and she said to me: “Sir Richard, will it please you enter your Great
            Hall?” Then she wept, but we were alone.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The knight was silent for a long time, his face turned across the valley, smiling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, well done!’ said Una, and clapped her hands very softly. ‘She was sorry, and she
            said so.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Aye, she was sorry, and she said so,’ said Sir Richard, coming back with a little
            start. ‘Very soon—but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></span> said it was two full hours later—De
            Aquila rode to the door, with his shield new scoured (Hugh had cleansed it), <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and demanded entertainment, and called me a false knight, that
            would starve his overlord to death. Then Hugh cried out that no man should work in the
            valley that day, and our Saxons blew horns, and set about feasting and drinking, and
            running of races, and dancing and singing; and De Aquila climbed upon a horse-block and
            spoke to them in what he swore was good Saxon, but no man understood it. At night we
            feasted in the Great Hall, and when the harpers and the singers were gone we four sat
            late at the high table. As I remember, it was a warm night with a full moon, and De
            Aquila bade Hugh take down his sword from the wall again, for the honour of the Manor of
            Dallington, and Hugh took it gladly enough. Dust lay on the hilt, for I saw him blow it
            off. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘She and I sat talking a little apart, and at first we thought the harpers had come
            back, for the Great Hall was filled with a rushing noise of music. De Aquila leaped up;
            but there was only the moonlight fretty on the floor. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Hearken!” said Hugh. “It is my sword,” and as he belted it on the music ceased. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Over Gods, forbid that I should ever belt blade like that,” said De Aquila. “What
            does it foretell?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“The Gods that made it may know. Last time it spoke was at Hastings, when I lost all
            my lands. Belike it sings now that I have new lands and am a man again,” said Hugh. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He loosed the blade a little and drove it back happily into the sheath, and the sword
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>answered him low and crooningly, as—as a woman would
            speak to a man, her head on his shoulder. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Now that was the second time in all my life I heard this Sword sing.’... </p>
          <div class="tei tei-tb"> </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Look!’ said Una. ‘There’s mother coming down the Long Slip. What will she say to Sir
            Richard? She can’t help seeing him.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And Puck can’t magic us this time,’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Are you sure?’ said Puck; and he leaned forward and whispered to Sir Richard, who,
            smiling, bowed his head. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But what befell the sword and my brother Hugh I will tell on another time,’ said he,
            rising. ‘Ohé, Swallow!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The great horse cantered up from the far end of the meadow, close to mother. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They heard mother say: ‘Children, Gleason’s old horse has broken into the meadow
            again. Where did he get through?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Just below Stone Bay,’ said Dan. ‘He tore down simple flobs of the bank! We noticed
            it just now. And we’ve caught no end of fish. We’ve been at it all the afternoon.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And they honestly believed that they had. They never noticed the Oak, Ash, and Thorn
            leaves that Puck had slyly thrown into their laps. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was too hot to run about in the open, so Dan asked their friend, old Hobden, to
            take their own dinghy from the pond and put her on the brook at the bottom of the
            garden. Her painted name was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Daisy</span></span>, but for exploring
            expeditions she was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golden Hind</span></span> or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Long
              Serpent</span></span>, or some such suitable name. Dan hiked and howked with a boat-hook (the
            brook was too narrow for sculls), and Una punted with a piece of hop-pole. When they
            came to a very shallow place (the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golden Hind</span></span> drew quite three
            inches of water) they disembarked and scuffled her over the gravel by her tow-rope, and
            when they reached the overgrown banks beyond the garden they pulled themselves up stream
            by the low branches. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That day they intended to discover the North Cape like ‘Othere, the old sea-captain,’
            in the book of verses which Una had brought with her; but on account of the heat they
            changed it to a voyage up the Amazon and the sources of the Nile. Even on the shaded
            water the air was hot and heavy with drowsy scents, while outside, through breaks in the
            trees, the sunshine burned the pasture like fire. The kingfisher was asleep on his
            watching-branch, and the blackbirds scarcely took the trouble to dive into the next
            bush. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Dragon-flies wheeling and clashing were the only
            things at work, except the moor-hens and a big Red Admiral who flapped down out of the
            sunshine for a drink. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When they reached Otter Pool the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golden Hind</span></span> grounded
            comfortably on a shallow, and they lay beneath a roof of close green, watching the water
            trickle over the floodgates down the mossy brick chute from the mill-stream to the
            brook. A big trout—the children knew him well—rolled head and shoulders at some fly
            that sailed round the bend, while once in just so often the brook rose a fraction of an
            inch against all the wet pebbles, and they watched the slow draw and shiver of a breath
            of air through the tree-tops. Then the little voices of the slipping water began again. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It’s like the shadows talking, isn’t it?’ said Una. She had given up trying to read.
            Dan lay over the bows, trailing his hands in the current. They heard feet on the
            gravel-bar that runs half across the pool and saw Sir Richard Dalyngridge standing over
            them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Was yours a dangerous voyage?’ he asked, smiling. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘She bumped a lot, sir,’ said Dan. ‘There’s hardly any water this summer.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ah, the brook was deeper and wider when my children played at Danish pirates. Are you
            <span class="tei tei-corr">pirate-folk?’</span> </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, no. We gave up being pirates years ago,’ explained Una. ‘We’re nearly always
            explorers now. Sailing round the world, you know.’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Round?’ said Sir Richard. He sat him in the comfortable crotch of the old ash-root on
            the bank. ‘How can it be round?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Wasn’t it in your books?’ Dan suggested. He had been doing geography at his last
            lesson. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I can neither write nor read,’ he replied. ‘Canst <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thou</span></span> read,
            child?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes,’ said Dan, ‘barring the very long words.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Wonderful! Read to me, that I may hear for myself.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan flushed, but opened the book and began—gabbling a little—at ‘The Discoverer of
            the North Cape.’ </p>

            shadows of the leaves slipped and slid upon his chain-mail. </p>

          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A nameless sea!’ he repeated. ‘So did I—so did Hugh and I.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Where did you go? Tell us,’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Wait. Let me hear all first.’ So Dan read to the poem’s very end. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Good,’ said the knight. ‘That is Othere’s tale—even as I have heard the men in the
            Dane ships sing it. Not in those same valiant words, but something like to them.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Have you ever explored North?’ Dan shut the book. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay. My venture was South. Farther South than any man has fared, Hugh and I went down
            with Witta and his heathen.’ He jerked the tall sword forward, and leaned on it with
            both hands; but his eyes looked long past them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I thought you always lived here,’ said Una, timidly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> <span class="tei tei-corr">‘Yes;</span> while my Lady Ælueva lived. But she died. She died. Then, my eldest son being a
            man, I asked De Aquila’s leave that he should hold the Manor while I went on some
            journey or pilgrimage—to forget. De Aquila, whom the Second William had made Warden of
            Pevensey in Earl Mortain’s place, was very old then, but still he rode his tall, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>roan horses, and in the saddle he looked like a little
            white falcon. When Hugh, at Dallington over yonder, heard what I did, he sent for my
            second son, whom being unmarried he had ever looked upon as his own child, and, by De
            Aquila’s leave, gave him the Manor of Dallington to hold till he should return. Then
            Hugh came with me.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When did this happen?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That I can answer to the very day, for as we rode with De Aquila by Pevensey—have I
            said that he was Lord of Pevensey and of the Honour of the Eagle?—to the Bordeaux ship
            that fetched him his wines yearly out of France, a Marsh man ran to us crying that he
            had seen a great black goat which bore on his back the body of the King, and that the
            goat had spoken to him. On that same day Red William our King, the Conqueror’s son, died
            of a secret arrow while he hunted in a forest. “This is a cross matter,” said De Aquila,
            “to meet on the threshold of a journey. If Red William be dead I may have to fight for
            my lands. Wait a little.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘My Lady being dead, I cared nothing for signs and omens, nor Hugh either. We took
            that wine-ship to go to Bordeaux; but the wind failed while we were yet in sight of
            Pevensey; a thick mist hid us, and we drifted with the tide along the cliffs to the
            west. Our company was, for the most part, merchants returning to France, and we were
            laden with wool and there were three couple of tall hunting-dogs chained to the rail.
            Their master was a knight of Artois. His name I never <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>learned, but his shield bore gold pieces on a red ground, and he limped much as I do,
            from a wound which he had got in his youth at Mantes siege. He served the Duke of
            Burgundy against the Moors in Spain, and was returning to that war with his dogs. He
            sang us strange Moorish songs that first night, and half persuaded us to go with him. I
            was on pilgrimage to forget—which is what no pilgrimage brings. I think I would have
            gone, but.... </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Look you how the life and fortune of man changes! Towards morning a Dane ship, rowing
            silently, struck against us in the mist, and while we rolled hither and yon Hugh,
            leaning over the rail, fell outboard. I leaped after him, and we two tumbled aboard the
            Dane, and were caught and bound ere we could rise. Our own ship was swallowed up in the
            mist. I judge the Knight of the Gold Pieces muzzled his dogs with his cloak, lest they
            should give tongue and betray the merchants, for I heard their baying suddenly stop. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We lay bound among the benches till morning, when the Danes dragged us to the high
            deck by the steering-place, and their captain—Witta, he was called—turned us over with
            his foot. Bracelets of gold from elbow to armpit he wore, and his red hair was long as a
            woman’s, and came down in plaited locks on his shoulder. He was stout, with bowed legs
            and long arms. He spoiled us of all we had, but when he laid hand on Hugh’s sword and
            saw the runes on the blade hastily he thrust it back. Yet his covetousness over<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>came him and he tried again and again, and the third time
            the Sword sang loud and angrily, so that the rowers leaned on their oars to listen. Here
            they all spoke together, screaming like gulls, and a Yellow Man, such as I have never
            seen, came to the high deck and cut our bonds. He was yellow—not from sickness, but by
            nature. Yellow as honey, and his eyes stood endwise in his head.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How do you mean?’ said Una, her chin on her hand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Thus,’ said Sir Richard. He put a finger to the corner of each eye, and pushed it up
            till his eyes narrowed to slits. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why, you look just like a Chinaman!’ cried Dan. ‘Was the man a Chinaman?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I know not what that may be. Witta had found him half dead among ice on the shores of
            Muscovy. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We</span></span> thought he was a devil. He crawled before us and
            brought food in a silver dish which these sea-wolves had robbed from some rich abbey,
            and Witta with his own hands gave us wine. He spoke a little in French, a little in
            South Saxon, and much in the Northman’s tongue. We asked him to set us ashore, promising
            to pay him better ransom than he would get price if he sold us to the Moors—as once
            befell a knight of my acquaintance sailing from Flushing. </p>

            old pilgrims that can neither work nor fight?” </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Swim to England or France,” said Witta. “We are midway between the two. Unless ye
            choose to drown yourselves no hair of your head will be harmed here aboard. We think ye
            bring us luck, and I myself know the runes on that Sword are good.” He turned and bade
            them hoist sail. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Long, low, and narrow, bearing one mast with a red sail, and rowed by fifteen oars a
            side,’ the knight answered. ‘At her bows was a deck under which men might lie, and at
            her stern another shut off by a painted door from the rowers’ benches. Here Hugh and I
            slept, with Witta and the Yellow Man, upon tapestries as soft as wool. I remember’—he
            laughed to himself—‘when first we entered there a loud voice cried, “Out swords! Out
            swords! Kill, <span class="tei tei-corr">kill!”</span> Seeing us start Witta laughed, and showed us it was but a
            great-beaked grey bird with a red tail. He sat her on his shoulder, and she called for
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bread and wine hoarsely, and prayed him to kiss her.
            Yet she was no more than a silly bird. But—ye knew this?’ He looked at their smiling
            faces. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We weren’t laughing at you,’ said Una. ‘That must have been a parrot. It’s just what
            Pollies do.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So we learned later. But here is another marvel. The Yellow Man, whose name was
            Kitai, had with him a brown box. In the box was a blue bowl with red marks upon the rim,
            and within the bowl, hanging from a fine thread, was a piece of iron no thicker than
            that grass stem, and as long, maybe, as my spur, but straight. In this iron, said Witta,
            abode an Evil Spirit which <span class="tei tei-corr">Kitai,</span> the Yellow Man, had brought by Art Magic out of his own
            country that lay three years’ journey southward. The Evil Spirit strove day and night to
            return to his country, and therefore, look you, the iron needle pointed continually to
            the South.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘South?’ said Dan, suddenly, and put his hand into his pocket. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘With my own eyes I saw it. Every day and all day long, though the ship rolled, though
            the sun and the moon and the stars were hid, this blind Spirit in the iron knew whither
            it would go, and strained to the South. Witta called it the Wise Iron, because it showed
            him his way across the unknowable seas.’ Again Sir Richard looked keenly at the
            children. ‘How think ye? Was it sorcery?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Was it anything like this?’ Dan fished <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>out his old
            brass pocket-compass, that generally lived with his knife and key-ring. ‘The glass has
            got cracked, but the needle waggles all right, sir.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The knight drew a long breath of wonder. ‘Yes, yes. The Wise Iron shook and swung in
            just this fashion. Now it is still. Now it points to the South.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘North,’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay, South! There is the South,’ said Sir Richard. Then they both laughed, for
            naturally when one end of a straight compass-needle points to the North, the other must
            point to the South. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Té,’ said Sir Richard, clicking his tongue. ‘There can be no sorcery if a child
            carries it. Wherefore does it point South—or North?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Father says that nobody knows,’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sir Richard looked relieved. ‘Then it may still be magic. It was magic to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></span>. And so we voyaged. When the wind served we hoisted sail, and
            lay all up along the windward rail, our shields on our backs to break the spray. When it
            failed, they rowed with long oars; the Yellow Man sat by the Wise Iron, and Witta
            steered. At first I feared the great white-flowering waves, but as I saw how wisely
            Witta led his ship among them I grew bolder. Hugh liked it well from the first. My skill
            is not upon the water; and rocks, and whirlpools such as we saw by the West Isles of
            France, where an oar caught on a rock and broke, are much against my stomach. We sailed
            South across a stormy sea, where by moonlight, between clouds, we saw a Flanders <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ship roll clean over and sink. Again, though Hugh
            laboured with Witta all night, I lay under the deck with the Talking Bird, and cared not
            whether I lived or died. There is a sickness of the sea which, for three days, is pure
            death! When we next saw land Witta said it was Spain, and we stood out to sea. That
            coast was full of ships busy in the Duke’s war against the Moors, and we feared to be
            hanged by the Duke’s men or sold into slavery by the Moors. So we put into a small
            harbour which Witta knew. At night men came down with loaded mules, and Witta exchanged
            amber out of the North against little wedges of iron and packets of beads in earthen
            pots. The pots he put under the decks, and the wedges of iron he laid on the bottom of
            the ship after he had cast out the stones and shingle which till then had been our
            ballast. Wine, too, he bought for lumps of sweet-smelling grey amber—a little morsel no
            bigger than a thumbnail purchased a cask of wine. But I speak like a merchant.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No, no! Tell us what you had to eat,’ cried Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Meat dried in the sun, and dried fish and ground beans, Witta took in; and corded
            frails of a certain sweet, soft fruit, which the Moors use, which is like paste of figs,
            but with thin, long stones. Aha! Dates is the name. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Now,” said Witta, when the ship was loaded, “I counsel you <span class="tei tei-sic">strangers,</span> to pray to
            your gods, for from here on our road is No Man’s road.” He and his men killed a black
            goat for sacrifice on the bows; and the Yellow <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Man
            brought out a small, smiling image of dull-green glass and burned incense before it.
            Hugh and I commended ourselves to God, and Saint Bartholomew, and Our Lady of the
            Assumption, who was specially dear to my Lady. We were not young, but I think no shame
            to say, when as we drove out of that secret harbour at sunrise over a still sea, we two
            rejoiced and sang as did the knights of old when they followed our great Duke to
            England. Yet was our leader an heathen pirate; all our proud fleet but one galley
            perilously overloaded; for guidance we leaned on a pagan sorcerer; and our port was
            beyond the world’s end. Witta told us that his father Guthrum had once in his life rowed
            along the shores of Africa to a land where naked men sold gold for iron and beads. There
            had he bought much gold, and no few elephants’ teeth, and thither by help of the Wise
            Iron would Witta go. Witta feared nothing—except to be poor. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“My father told me,” said Witta, “that a great Shoal runs three days’ sail out from
            that land, and south of the shoal lies a Forest which grows in the sea. South and east
            of the Forest my father came to a place where the men hid gold in their hair; but all
            that country, he said, was full of Devils who lived in trees, and tore folk limb from
            limb. How think ye?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Gold or no gold,” said Hugh, fingering his sword, “it is a joyous venture. Have at
            these devils of thine, Witta!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Venture!” said Witta, sourly. “I am <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only a poor
            sea-thief. I do not set my life adrift on a plank for joy, or the venture. Once I beach
            ship again at Stavanger, and feel the wife’s arms round my neck, I’ll seek no more
            ventures. A ship is heavier care than a wife or cattle.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He leaped down among the rowers, chiding them for their little strength and their
            great stomachs. Yet Witta was a wolf in fight, and a very fox in cunning. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We were driven South by a storm, and for three days and three nights he took the
            stern-oar and threddled the longship through the sea. When it rose beyond measure he
            brake a pot of whale’s oil upon the water, which wonderfully smoothed it, and in that
            anointed patch he turned her head to the wind and threw out oars at the end of a rope,
            to make, he said, an anchor at which we lay rolling sorely, but dry. This craft his
            father Guthrum had shown him. He knew, too, all the Leech-Book of Bald, who was a wise
            doctor, and he knew the Ship-Book of Hlaf the Woman, who robbed Egypt. He knew all the
            care of a ship. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘After the storm we saw a mountain whose top was covered with snow and pierced the
            clouds. The grasses under this mountain, boiled and eaten, are a good cure for soreness
            of the gums and swelled ankles. We lay there eight days, till men in skins threw stones
            at us. When the heat increased Witta spread a cloth on bent sticks above the rowers, for
            the wind failed between the Island of the Mountain and the shore of Africa, which is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>east of it. That shore is sandy, and we rowed along it
            within three bowshots. Here we saw whales, and fish in the shape of shields, but longer
            than our ship. Some slept, some opened their mouths at us, and some danced on the hot
            waters. The water was hot to the hand, and the sky was hidden by hot, grey mists, out of
            which blew a fine dust that whitened our hair and beards of a morning. Here, too, were
            fish that flew in the air like birds. They would fall on the laps of the rowers, and
            when we went ashore we would roast and eat them.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The knight paused to see if the children doubted him, but they only nodded and said,
            ‘Go on.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The yellow land lay on our left, the grey sea on our right. Knight though I was, I
            pulled my oar amongst the rowers. I caught seaweed and dried it, and stuffed it between
            the pots of beads lest they should break. Knighthood is for the land. At sea, look you,
            a man is but a spurless rider on a bridleless horse. I learned to make strong knots in
            ropes—yes, and to join two ropes end to end, so that even Witta could scarcely see
            where they had been married. But Hugh had tenfold more sea-cunning than I. Witta gave
            him charge of the rowers of the left side. Thorkild of Borkum, a man with a broken nose,
            that wore a Norman steel cap, had the rowers of the right, and each side rowed and sang
            against the other. They saw that no man was idle. Truly, as Hugh said, and Witta would
            laugh at him, a ship is all more care than a Manor. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span>
          <a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How? Thus. There was water to fetch from the shore when we could find it, as well as
            wild fruit and grasses, and sand for scrubbing of the decks and benches to keep them
            sweet. Also we hauled the ship out on low islands and emptied all her gear, even to the
            iron wedges, and burned off the weed, that had grown on her, with torches of rush, and
            smoked below the decks with rushes dampened in salt water, as Hlaf the Woman orders in
            her Ship-Book. Once when we were thus stripped, and the ship lay propped on her keel,
            the bird cried, “Out swords!” as though she saw an enemy. Witta vowed he would wring her
            neck.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Poor Polly! Did he?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay. She was the ship’s bird. She could call all the rowers by name.... Those were
            good days—for a wifeless man—with Witta and his heathen—beyond the world’s end....
            After many weeks we came on the Great Shoal which stretched, as Witta’s father had said,
            far out to sea. We skirted it till we were giddy with the sight and dizzy with the sound
            of bars and breakers; and when we reached land again we found a naked black people
            dwelling among woods, who for one wedge of iron loaded us with fruits and grasses and
            eggs. Witta scratched his head at them in sign he would buy gold. They had no gold, but
            they understood the sign (all the gold-traders hide their gold in their thick hair), for
            they pointed along the coast. They beat, too, on their chests with their clenched hands,
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and that, if we had known it, was an evil sign.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did it mean?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Patience. Ye shall hear. We followed the coast eastward sixteen days (counting time
            by sword-cuts on the helm-rail) till we came to the Forest in the Sea. Trees grew out of
            mud, arched upon lean and high roots, and many muddy water-ways ran allwhither into
            darkness under the trees. Here we lost the sun. We followed the winding channels between
            the trees, and <span class="tei tei-corr">where</span> we could not row we laid hold of the
            crusted roots and hauled ourselves along. The water was foul, and great glittering flies
            tormented us. Morning and evening a blue mist covered the mud, which bred fevers. Four
            of our rowers sickened, and were bound to their benches, lest they should leap overboard
            and be eaten by the monsters of the mud. The Yellow Man lay sick beside the Wise Iron,
            rolling his head and talking in his own tongue. Only the Bird throve. She sat on Witta’s
            shoulder and screamed in that noisome, silent darkness. Yes; I think it was the silence
            we feared.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He paused to listen to the comfortable home noises of the brook. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When we had lost count of time among those black gullies and swashes, we heard, as it
            were, a drum beat far off, and following it we broke into a broad, brown river by a hut
            in a clearing among fields of pumkins. We thanked God to see the sun again. The people
            of the village gave the good welcome, and Witta scratched his head at them (for gold),
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and showed them our iron and beads. They ran to the
            bank—we were still in the ship—and pointed to our swords and bows, for always when
            near shore we lay armed. Soon they fetched store of gold in bars and in dust from their
            huts, and some great blackened elephant teeth. These they piled on the bank, as though
            to tempt us, and made signs of dealing blows in battle, and pointed up to the tree tops,
            and to the forest behind. Their captain or chief sorcerer then beat on his chest with
            his fists, and gnashed his teeth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Said Thorkild of Borkum: “Do they mean we must fight for all this gear?” and he half
            drew his sword. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Nay,” said Hugh. “I think they ask us to league against some enemy.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I like this not,” said Witta, of a sudden. “Back into midstream.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So we did, and sat still all, watching the black folk and the gold they piled on the
            bank. Again we heard drums beat in the forest, and the people fled to their huts,
            leaving the gold unguarded. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then Hugh, at the bows, pointed without speech, and we saw a great Devil come out of
            the forest. He shaded his brows with his hand, and moistened his pink tongue between his
            lips—thus.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A Devil!’ said Dan, delightfully horrified. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yea. Taller than a man; covered with reddish hair. When he had well regarded our
            ship, he beat on his chest with his fists till it sounded like rolling drums, and came
            to the bank swinging all his body between his long <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>arms, and gnashed his teeth at us. Hugh loosed arrow, and pierced him through the
            throat. He fell roaring, and three other Devils ran out of the forest and hauled him
            into a tall tree out of sight. Anon they cast down the blood-stained arrow, and lamented
            together among the leaves. Witta saw the gold on the bank; he was loath to leave it.
            “Sirs,” said he (no man had spoken till then), “yonder is that we have come so far and
            so painfully to find, laid out to our very hand. Let us row in while these Devils bewail
            themselves, and at least bear off what we may.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Bold as a wolf, cunning as a fox was Witta! He set four archers on the foredeck to
            shoot the Devils if they should leap from the tree, which was close to the bank. He
            manned ten oars a side, and bade them watch his hand to row in or back out, and so
            coaxed he them toward the bank. But none would set foot ashore, though the gold was
            within ten paces. No man is hasty to his hanging. They whimpered at their oars like
            beaten hounds, and Witta bit his fingers for rage. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Said Hugh of a sudden, “Hark!” At first we thought it was the buzzing of the
            glittering flies on the water, but it grew loud and fierce, so that all men heard.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What?’ said Dan and Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It was the sword.’ Sir Richard patted the smooth hilt. ‘It sang as a Dane sings
            before battle. “I go,” said Hugh, and he leaped from the bows and fell among the gold. I
            was afraid to my four bones’ marrow, but for shame’s sake I followed, and Thorkild of
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Borkum leaped after me. None other came. “Blame me
            not,” cried Witta behind us, “I must abide by my ship.” We three had no time to blame or
            praise. We stooped to the gold and threw it back over our shoulders, one hand on our
            swords and one eye on the tree, which nigh overhung us. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I know not how the Devils leaped down, or how the fight began. I heard Hugh cry:
            “Out! out!” as though he were at Santlache again; I saw Thorkild’s steel cap smitten off
            his head by a great hairy hand, and I felt an arrow from the ship whistle past my ear.
            They say that till Witta took his sword to the rowers he could not bring his ship in
            shore; and each one of the four archers said afterwards that he alone had pierced the
            Devil that fought me. I do not know. I went to it in my mail-shirt, which saved my skin.
            With long-sword and belt-dagger I fought for the life against a Devil whose very feet
            were hands, and who whirled me back and forth like a dead branch. He had me by the
            waist, my arms to my side, when an arrow from the ship pierced him between the
            shoulders, and he loosened grip. I passed my sword twice through him, and he crutched
            himself away between his long arms, coughing and moaning. Next, as I remember, I saw
            Thorkild of Borkum bareheaded and smiling, leaping up and down before a Devil that
            leaped and gnashed his teeth. Then Hugh passed, his sword shifted to his left hand, and
            I wondered why I had not known that Hugh was a left-handed man; and thereafter I
            remembered nothing till I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>felt spray on my face, and we
            were in sunshine on the open sea. That was twenty days after.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What had happened? Did Hugh die?’ the children asked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Never was such a fight fought by christened man,’ said Sir Richard. ‘An arrow from
            the ship had saved me from my Devil, and Thorkild of Borkum had given back before his
            Devil, till the bowmen on the ship could shoot it all full of arrows from near by; but
            Hugh’s Devil was cunning, and had kept behind trees, where no arrow could reach. Body to
            body there, by stark strength of sword and hand, had Hugh slain him, and, dying, the
            Thing had clenched his teeth on the sword. Judge what teeth they were!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sir Richard turned the sword again that the children might see the two great chiselled
            gouges on either side of the blade. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Those same teeth met in Hugh’s right arm and side,’ Sir Richard went on. ‘I? Oh, I
            had no more than a broken foot and a fever. Thorkild’s ear was bitten, but Hugh’s arm
            and side clean withered away. I saw him where he lay along, sucking a fruit in his left
            hand. His flesh was wasted off his bones, his hair was patched with white, and his hand
            was blue-veined like a woman’s. He put his left hand round my neck and whispered, “Take
            my sword. It has been thine since Hastings, O, my brother, but I can never hold hilt
            again.” We lay there on the high deck talking of Santlache and, I think, of every day
            since Santlache, and it came so that we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>both wept. I
            was weak, and he little more than a shadow. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Nay—nay,” said Witta, at the helm-rail. “Gold is a good right arm to any man.
            Look—look at the gold!” He bade Thorkild show us the gold and the elephants’ teeth, as
            though we had been children. He had brought away all the gold on the bank, and twice as
            much more, that the people of the village gave him for slaying the Devils. They
            worshipped us as gods, Thorkild told me: it was one of their old women healed up Hugh’s
            poor arm.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How much gold did you get?’ asked Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How can I say? Where we came out with wedges of iron under the rowers’ feet we
            returned with wedges of gold hidden beneath planks. There was dust of gold in packages
            where we slept; and along the side and crosswise under the benches we lashed the
            blackened elephants’ teeth. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I had sooner have my right arm,” said Hugh, when he had seen all. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Ahai! That was my fault,” said Witta. “I should have taken ransom and landed you in
            France when first you came aboard, ten months ago.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“It is over-late now,” said Hugh, laughing. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Witta plucked at his long shoulder-lock. “But think!” said he. “If I had let ye
            go—which I swear I would never have done, for I love ye more than brothers—if I had
            let ye go, by now ye might have been horribly slain by some mere Moor in the Duke of
            Burgundy’s war, or ye might have been murdered by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>land-thieves, or ye might have died of the plague at an inn. Think of this and do not
            blame me overmuch, Hugh. See! I will only take a half of the gold.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I blame thee not at all, Witta,” said Hugh. “It was a joyous venture, and we
            thirty-five here have done what never men have done. If I live till England, I will
            build me a stout keep over Dallington out of my share.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I will buy cattle and amber and warm red cloth for the wife,” said Witta, “and I
            will hold all the land at the head of Stavanger Fiord. Many will fight for me now. But
            first we must turn North, and with this honest treasure aboard I pray we meet no pirate
            ships.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We did not laugh. We were careful. We were afraid lest we should lose one grain of
            our gold for which we had fought Devils. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Where is the Sorcerer?” said I, for Witta was looking at the Wise Iron in the box,
            and I could not see the Yellow Man. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He has gone to his own country,” said he. “He rose up in the night while we were
            beating out of that forest in the mud, and said that he could see it behind the trees.
            He leaped out on to the mud, and did not answer when we called; so we called no more. He
            left the Wise Iron, which is all that I care for—and see, the Spirit still points to
            the South!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We were troubled for fear that the Wise Iron should fail us now that its Yellow Man
            had gone, and when we saw the Spirit still served us we grew afraid of too strong winds,
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and of shoals, and of careless leaping fish, and of
            all the people on all the shores where we landed.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Because of the gold—because of our gold. Gold changes men altogether. Thorkild of
            Borkum did not change. He laughed at Witta for his fears, and at us for our counselling
            Witta to furl sail when the ship pitched at all. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Better be drowned out of hand,” said Thorkild of Borkum, “than go tied to a
            deck-load of yellow dust.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He was a landless man, and had been slave to some King in the East. He would have
            beaten out the gold into deep bands to put round the oars, and round the prow. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yet, though he vexed himself for the gold, Witta waited upon Hugh like a woman,
            lending him his shoulder when the ship rolled, and tying of ropes from side to side that
            Hugh might hold by them. But for Hugh, he said—and so did all his men—they would never
            have won the gold. I remember Witta made a little, thin gold ring for our Bird to swing
            in. Three months we rowed and sailed and went ashore for fruits or to clean the ship.
            When we saw wild horsemen, riding among sand-dunes, flourishing spears we knew we were
            on the Moors’ coast, and stood over north to Spain; and a strong south-west wind bore us
            in ten days to a coast of high red rocks, where we heard a hunting-horn blow among the
            yellow gorse and knew it was England. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Now find ye Pevensey yourselves,” said <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Witta. “I
            love not these narrow ship-filled seas.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He set the dried, salted head of the Devil, which Hugh had killed, high on our prow,
            and all boats fled from us. Yet, for our gold’s sake, we were more afraid than they. We
            crept along the coast by night till we came to the chalk cliffs, and so east to
            Pevensey. Witta would not come ashore with us, though Hugh promised him wine at
            Dallington enough to swim in. He was on fire to see his wife, and ran into the Marsh
            after sunset, and there he left us and our share of gold, and backed out on the same
            tide. He made no promise; he swore no oath; he looked for no thanks; but to Hugh, an
            armless man, and to me, an old cripple whom he could have flung into the sea, he passed
            over wedge upon wedge, packet upon packet of gold and dust of gold, and only ceased when
            we would take no more. As he stooped from the rail to bid us farewell he stripped off
            his right-arm bracelets and put them all on Hugh’s left, and he kissed Hugh on the
            cheek. I think when Thorkild of Borkum bade the rowers give way we were near weeping. It
            is true that Witta was an heathen and a pirate; true it is he held us by force many
            months in his ship, but I loved that bow-legged, blue-eyed man for his great boldness,
            his cunning, his skill, and, beyond all, for his simplicity.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Did he get home all right?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I never knew. We saw him hoist sail under the moon-track and stand away. I have
            prayed that he found his wife and the children.’ </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And what did you do?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We waited on the Marsh till the day. Then I sat by the gold, all tied in an old sail,
            while Hugh went to Pevensey, and De Aquila sent us horses.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sir Richard crossed hands on his sword-hilt, and stared down stream through the soft
            warm shadows. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A whole shipload of <span class="tei tei-corr">gold!’</span> said Una, looking at the little <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golden
              Hind</span></span>. ‘But I’m glad I didn’t see the Devils.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I don’t believe they were Devils,’ Dan whispered back. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Eh?’ said Sir Richard. ‘Witta’s father warned him they were unquestionable Devils.
            One must believe one’s father, and not one’s children. What were my Devils, then?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan flushed all over. ‘I—I only thought,’ he stammered; ‘I’ve got a book called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Gorilla Hunters</span></span>—it’s a continuation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coral
              Island</span></span>, sir—and it says there that the gorillas (they’re big monkeys, you know)
            were always chewing iron up.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Not always,’ said Una. ‘Only twice.’ They had been reading <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
              Gorilla Hunters</span></span> in the orchard. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Well, anyhow, they always drummed on their chests, like Sir Richard’s did, before
            they went for people. And they built houses in trees, too.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ha!’ Sir Richard opened his eyes. ‘Houses like flat nests did our Devils make, where
            their imps lay and looked at us. I did not see them (I was sick after the fight), but
            Witta told me and, lo, ye know it also? Won<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>derful! Were
            our Devils only nest-building apes? Is there no sorcery left in the world?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I don’t know,’ answered Dan, uncomfortably. ‘I’ve seen a man take rabbits out of a
            hat, and he told us we could see how he did it, if we watched hard. And we did.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But we didn’t,’ said Una sighing. ‘Oh! there’s Puck!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The little fellow, brown and smiling, peered between two stems of an ash, nodded, and
            slid down the bank into the cool beside them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No sorcery, Sir Richard?’ he laughed, and blew on a full dandelion head he had
            picked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They tell me that Witta’s Wise Iron was a toy. The boy carries such an Iron with him.
            They tell me our Devils were apes, called gorillas!’ said Sir Richard, indignantly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That is the sorcery of books,’ said Puck. ‘I warned thee they were wise children. All
            people can be wise by reading of books.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But are the books true?’ Sir Richard frowned. ‘I like not all this reading and
            writing.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ye-es,’ said Puck, holding the naked dandelion head at arm’s length. ‘But if we hang
            all fellows who write falsely, why did De Aquila not begin with Gilbert, the Clerk? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></span> was false enough.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Poor false Gilbert. Yet in his fashion, he was bold,’ said Sir Richard. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did he do?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He wrote,’ said Sir Richard. ‘Is the tale meet for children, think you?’ He looked at
            Puck; but, ‘Tell us! Tell us!’ cried Dan and Una together. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It has nought to do with apes or devils,’ Sir Richard went on, in an undertone. ‘It
            concerns De Aquila, than whom there was never bolder nor craftier, nor more hardy knight
            born. And, remember, he was an old, old man at that time.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When we came back from sailing with Witta.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did you do with your gold?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Have patience. Link by link is chain-mail made. I will tell all in its place. We bore
            the gold to Pevensey on horseback—three loads of it—and then up to the north chamber,
            above the Great Hall of Pevensey Castle, where De Aquila lay in winter. He sat on his
            bed like a little white falcon, turning his head swiftly from one to the other as we
            told our tale. Jehan the Crab, an old sour man-at-arms, guarded the stairway, but De
            Aquila bade him wait at the stair-foot, and let down both leather curtains over the
            door. It was Jehan whom De Aquila had sent to us with the horses, and only Jehan had
            loaded the gold. When our story was told, De Aquila gave us the news of England, for we
            were as men waked from a year-long sleep. The Red King was dead—slain (ye remember?)
            the day we set sail—and Henry, his younger <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span><a name="P092" id="P092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>brother,
            had made himself King of England over the head of Robert of Normandy. This was the very
            thing that the Red King had done to Robert when our Great William died. Then Robert of
            Normandy, mad, as De Aquila said, at twice missing of this kingdom, had sent an army
            against England, which army had been well beaten back to their ships at Portsmouth. A
            little earlier, and Witta’s ship would have rowed through them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“And now,” said De Aquila, “half the great Barons of the north and west are out
            against the King between Salisbury and Shrewsbury; and half the other half wait to see
            which way the game shall go. They say Henry is overly English for their stomachs,
            because he hath married an English wife and she hath coaxed him to give back their old
            laws to our Saxons. (Better ride a horse on the bit he knows, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span>
            say.) But that is only a cloak to their falsehood.” He cracked his finger on the table
            where the wine was spilt, and thus he spoke:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“William crammed us Norman barons full of good English acres after Santlache. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> had my share too,” he said, and clapped Hugh on the shoulder;
            “but I warned him—I warned him before Odo rebelled—that he should have bidden the
            Barons give up their lands and lordships in Normandy if they would be English lords. Now
            they are all but princes both in England and Normandy—trencher-fed hounds, with a foot
            in one trough and both eyes on the other! Robert of Normandy has sent them word that if
            they do not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fight for him in England he will sack and
            harry out their lands in Normandy. Therefore Clare has risen, Fitz Osborn has risen,
            Montgomery has risen—whom our First William made an English earl. Even D’Arcy is out
            with his men, whose father I remember a little hedge-sparrow knight nearby Caen. If
            Henry wins, the Barons can still flee to Normandy, where Robert will welcome them. If
            Henry loses, Robert, he says, will give them more lands in England. Oh, a pest—a pest
            on Normandy, for she will be our England’s curse this many a long year!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Amen,” said Hugh. “But will the war come our ways, think you?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Not from the North,” said De Aquila. “But the sea is always open. If the Barons gain
            the upper hand Robert will send another army into England for sure; and this time I
            think he will land here—where his father, the Conqueror, landed. Ye have brought your
            pigs to a pretty market! Half England alight, and gold enough on the ground”—he stamped
            on the bars beneath the table—“to set every sword in Christendom fighting.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What is to do?” said Hugh. “I have no keep at Dallington; and if we buried it, whom
            could we trust?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Me,” said De Aquila. “Pevensey walls are strong. No man but Jehan, who is my dog,
            knows what is between them.” He drew a curtain by the shot-window and showed us the
            shaft of a well in the thickness of the wall. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I made it for a drinking-well,” he said, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>“but we
            found salt water, and it rises and falls with the tide. Hark!” We heard the water
            whistle and blow at the bottom. “Will it serve?” said he. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Needs must,” said Hugh. “Our lives are in thy hands.” So we lowered all the gold
            down except one small chest of it by De Aquila’s bed, which we kept as much for his
            delight in its weight and colour as for any our needs. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘In the morning, ere we rode to our Manors, he said: “I do not say farewell; because
            ye will return and bide here. Not for love nor for sorrow, but to be with the gold. Have
            a care,” he said, laughing, “lest I use it to make myself Pope. Trust me not, but
            return!”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sir Richard paused and smiled sadly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘In seven days, then, we returned from our Manors—from the Manors which had been
            ours.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And were the children quite well?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘My sons were young. Land and governance belong by right to young men.’ Sir Richard
            was talking to himself. ‘It would have broken their hearts if we had taken back our
            Manors. They made us great welcome, but we could see—Hugh and I could see—that our day
            was done. I was a cripple and he a one-armed man. No!’ He shook his head. ‘And
            therefore’—he raised his voice—‘we rode back to Pevensey.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’m sorry,’ said Una, for the knight seemed very sorrowful. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Little maid, it all passed long ago. They <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were
            young; we were old. We let them rule the Manors. “Aha!” cried De Aquila from his
            shot-window, when we dismounted. “Back again to earth, old foxes?” but when we were in
            his chamber above the hall he puts his arms about us and says, “Welcome, ghosts!
            Welcome, poor ghosts!”... Thus it fell out that we were rich beyond belief, and lonely.
            And lonely!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did you do?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We watched for Robert of Normandy,’ said the knight. ‘De Aquila was like Witta. He
            suffered no idleness. In fair weather we would ride along between Bexlei on the one
            side, to Cuckmere on the other—sometimes with hawk, sometimes with hound (there are
            stout hares both on the Marsh and the Downland), but always with an eye to the sea, for
            fear of fleets from Normandy. In foul weather he would walk on the top of his tower,
            frowning against the rain—peering here and pointing there. It always vexed him to think
            how Witta’s ship had come and gone without his knowledge. When the wind ceased and ships
            anchored, to the wharf’s edge he would go and, leaning on his sword among the stinking
            fish, would call to the mariners for their news from France. His other eye he kept
            landward for word of Henry’s war against the Barons. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Many brought him news—jongleurs, harpers, pedlars, sutlers, priests, and the like;
            and, though he was secret enough in small things, yet, if their news misliked him, then,
            regarding neither time nor place nor people, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would he
            curse our King Henry for a fool or a babe. I have heard him cry aloud by the
            fishing-boats: “If I were King of England I would do thus and thus”; and when I rode out
            to see that the warning-beacons were laid and dry, he hath often called to me from the
            shot-window: “Look to it, Richard! Do not copy our blind King, but see with thine own
            eyes and feel with thine own hands.” I do not think he knew any sort of fear. And so we
            lived at Pevensey, in the little chamber above the Hall. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘One foul night came word that a messenger of the King waited below. We were chilled
            after a long riding in the fog towards Bexlei, which is an easy place for ships to land.
            De Aquila sent word the man might either eat with us or wait till we had fed. Anon
            Jehan, at the stair-head, cried that he had called for horse, and was gone. “Pest on
            him!” said De Aquila. “I have more to do than to shiver in the Great Hall for every
            gadling the King sends. Left he no word?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“None,” said Jehan, “except”—he had been with De Aquila at Santlache—“except he
            said that if an old dog could not learn new tricks it was time to sweep out the kennel.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Oho!” said De Aquila, rubbing his nose, “to whom did he say that?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“To his beard, chiefly, but some to his horse’s flank as he was girthing up. I
            followed him out,” said Jehan the Crab. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What was his shield-mark?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Gold horseshoes on black,” said the Crab. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span>
          <a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“That is one of Fulke’s men,” said De Aquila.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Puck broke in very gently, ‘Gold horseshoes on black is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></span> the
            Fulkes’ shield. The Fulkes’ arms are——’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The knight waved one hand statelily. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Thou knowest that evil man’s true name,’ he replied, ‘but I have chosen to call him
            Fulke because I promised him I would not tell the story of his wickedness so that any
            man might guess it. I have changed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></span> the names in my tale. His
            children’s children may be still alive.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘True—true,’ said Puck, smiling softly. ‘It is knightly to keep faith—even after a
            thousand years.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sir Richard bowed a little and went on:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Gold horseshoes on black?” said De <span class="tei tei-corr">Aquila.</span> “I had heard Fulke had joined the
            Barons, but if this is true our King must be of the upper hand. No matter, all Fulkes
            are faithful. Still, I would not have sent the man away empty.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He fed,” said Jehan. “Gilbert the Clerk fetched him meat and wine from the kitchens.
            He ate at Gilbert’s table.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘This Gilbert was a clerk from Battle Abbey, who kept the accounts of the Manor of
            Pevensey. He was tall and pale-coloured, and carried those new-fashioned beads for
            counting of prayers. They were large brown nuts or seeds, and hanging from his girdle
            with his penner and inkhorn they clashed when he walked. His place was in the great
            fireplace. There was his table of accounts, and there he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lay o’ nights. He feared the hounds in the Hall that came nosing after bones or to
            sleep on the warm ashes, and would slash at them with his beads—like a woman. When De
            Aquila sat in Hall to do justice, take fines, or grant lands, Gilbert would so write it
            in the Manor-roll. But it was none of his work to feed our guests, or to let them depart
            without his lord’s knowledge. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Said De Aquila, after Jehan was gone down the stair: “Hugh, hast thou ever told my
            Gilbert thou canst read Latin hand-of-write?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No,” said Hugh. “He is no friend to me, or to Odo my hound either.” “No matter,”
            said De Aquila. “Let him never know thou canst tell one letter from its fellow,
            and”—here he jerked us in the ribs with his scabbard—“watch him both of ye. There be
            devils in Africa, as I have heard, but by the Saints there be greater devils in
            Pevensey!” And that was all he would say. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It chanced, some small while afterwards, a Norman man-at-arms would wed a Saxon wench
            of the Manor, and Gilbert (we had watched him well since De Aquila spoke) doubted
            whether her folk were free or slave. Since De Aquila would give them a field of good
            land, if she were free, the matter came up at the justice in Great Hall before De
            Aquila. First the wench’s father spoke; then her mother; then all together, till the
            hall rang and the hounds bayed. De Aquila held up his hands. “Write her free,” he called
            to Gilbert by the fireplace. “A’ God’s Name write her free, before she deafens me! Yes,
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>yes,” he said to the wench that was on her knees at
            him; “thou art Cerdic’s sister, and own cousin to the Lady of Mercia, if thou wilt be
            silent. In fifty years there will be neither Norman nor Saxon, but all English,” said
            he, “and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">these</span></span> are the men that do our work!” He clapped the
            man-at-arms, that was Jehan’s nephew, on the <span class="tei tei-corr">shoulder</span>, and
            kissed the wench, and fretted with his feet among the rushes to show it was finished.
            (The Great Hall is always bitter cold.) I stood at his side; Hugh was behind Gilbert in
            the fireplace making to play with wise rough Odo. He signed to De Aquila, who bade
            Gilbert measure the new field for the new couple. Out then runs our Gilbert between man
            and maid, his beads clashing at his waist, and the Hall being empty, we three sit by the
            fire. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Said Hugh, leaning down to the hearthstones, “I saw this stone move under Gilbert’s
            foot when Odo snuffed at it. <span class="tei tei-corr">Look!”</span> De Aquila digged in the ashes with his sword; the
            stone tilted; beneath it lay a parchment folden, and the writing atop was: “Words spoken
            against the King by our Lord of Pevensey—the second part.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Here was set out (Hugh read it us whispering) every jest De Aquila had made to us
            touching the King; every time he had called out to me from the shot-window, and every
            time he had said what he would do if he were King of England. Yes, day by day had his
            daily speech, which he never stinted, been set down by Gilbert, tricked out and twisted
            from its true meaning, yet withal so cunningly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that
            none could deny who knew him that De Aquila had in some sort spoken those words. Ye
            see?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan and Una nodded. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes,’ said Una, gravely. ‘It isn’t what you say so much. It’s what you mean when you
            say it. Like calling Dan a beast in fun. Only grown-ups don’t always understand.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He hath done this day by day before our very face?” said De Aquila. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> “Nay, hour by hour,” said Hugh. “When De Aquila spoke even now, in the hall, of Saxons
            and Normans, I saw Gilbert write on a parchment, which he kept beside the Manor-roll,
            that De Aquila said soon there would be no Normans left in England if his men-at-arms
            did their work aright.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Bones of the Saints!” said De Aquila. “What avail is honour or a sword against a
            pen? Where did Gilbert hide that writing? He shall eat it.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“In his breast when he ran out,” said Hugh. “Which made me look to see where he kept
            his finished stuff. When Odo scratched at this stone here, I saw his face change. So I
            was sure.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He is bold,” said De Aquila. “Do him justice. In his own fashion, my Gilbert is
            bold.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Overbold,” said Hugh. “Hearken here,” and he read: “Upon the feast of St. Agatha,

            reversed with rabbit——” </p>

            Dalyngridge, his drunken cup-mate” (here they laughed at me) “and said, ‘Peer out, old

            the wiser. Does he tell how we were out all day riding the marsh, and how I near
            perished in a quicksand, and coughed like a sick ewe for ten days after?” cried De
            Aquila. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No,” said Hugh. “But here is the prayer of Gilbert himself to his master Fulke.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Ah,” said De Aquila. “Well I knew it was Fulke. What is the price of my blood?” </p>

            another. When I am stripped of my lands Fulke will whip off my Gilbert’s foolish head.

            the King, who will hold us traitors.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Assuredly,” said De Aquila. “Fulke’s man took the first part that evening when
            Gilbert fed him, and our King is so beset by his brother and his Barons (small blame,
            too!) that he is mad with mistrust. Fulke has his ear, and pours poison into it.
            Presently the King gives him my land and yours. This is old,” and he <span class="tei tei-corr">leaned</span> back and yawned. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“And thou wilt surrender Pevensey without word or blow?” said Hugh. “We Saxons will
            fight your King then. I will go warn my nephew at Dallington. Give me a horse!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Give thee a toy and a rattle.” said De Aquila. “Put back the parchment, and rake
            over the ashes. If Fulke is given my Pevensey which is England’s gate, what will he do
            with it? He is Norman at heart, and his heart is in Normandy, where he can kill peasants
            at his pleasure. He will open England’s gate to our sleepy Robert, as Odo and Mortain
            tried to do, and then there will be another landing and another Santlache. Therefore I
            cannot give up Pevensey.” </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I do not think for myself,” said De Aquila, “nor for our King, nor for your lands. I
            think for England, for whom neither King nor Baron thinks. I am not Norman, Sir Richard,

            justice, he <span class="tei tei-corr">is a good</span> writer. Dead men make dumb witnesses. Wait.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“But the King may give Pevensey to Fulke. And our Manors go with it,” said I. “Shall
            we tell our sons?” </p>

            the bees in the North. He may hold me a traitor; but at least he sees I am not fighting
            against him, and every day that I lie still is so much gain to him while he fights the
            barons. If he were wise he would wait till that war were over before he made new
            enemies. But I think Fulke will play upon him to send for me, and if I do not obey the
            summons that will, to Henry’s mind, be proof of my treason. But mere talk, such as
            Gilbert sends, is no proof nowadays. We Barons follow the Church, and, like Anselm, we
            speak what we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>please. Let us go about our day’s
            dealings, and say naught to Gilbert.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Then we do nothing?” said Hugh. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“We wait,” said De Aquila. “I am old, but still I find that the most grievous work I
            know.” </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A little later in the year, armed men rode over the hill, the Golden Horseshoes
            flying behind the King’s banner. Said De Aquila, at the window of our chamber: “How did
            I tell you? Here comes Fulke himself to spy out his new lands which our King hath
            promised him if he can bring proof of my treason.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“How dost thou know?” said Hugh. </p>

            King’s Summons to leave Pevensey and join the war.” He sucked in his cheeks and drummed
            on the edge of the shaft, where the water sounded all hollow. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Shall we go?” said I. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Go! At this time of year? Stark madness,” said he. “Take <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></span>
            from Pevensey to fisk and flyte through fern and forest, and in three days Robert’s
            keels would be lying on Pevensey mud with ten thousand men! Who would stop them—Fulke?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The horns blew without, and anon Fulke cried the King’s Summons at the great door
            that De Aquila with all men and horse should join the King’s camp at Salisbury. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“How did I tell you?” said De Aquila. “There are twenty Barons ’twixt here and
            Salisbury could give King Henry good land-service, but he has been worked upon by Fulke
            to send south and call me—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">me!</span></span>—off the Gate of England, when his
            enemies stand about to batter it in. See that Fulke’s men lie in the big south barn,”
            said he. “Give them drink, and when Fulke has eaten we will drink in my chamber. The
            Great Hall is too cold for old bones.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘As soon as he was off-horse Fulke went to the chapel with Gilbert to give thanks for
            his safe coming, and when he had eaten—he was a fat man, and rolled his eyes greedily
            at our good roast Sussex wheatears—we led him to the little upper chamber, whither
            Gilbert had already gone with the Manor-roll. I remember when Fulke heard the tide blow
            and whistle in the shaft he leaped back, and his long down-turned stirrup-shoes caught
            in the rushes and he stumbled, so that Jehan behind him found it easy to knock his head
            against the wall.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Did you know it was going to happen?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Assuredly,’ said Sir Richard, with a sweet smile. ‘I put my foot on his sword and
            plucked away his dagger, but he knew not whether it was day or night for a while. He lay
            rolling his eyes and bubbling with his mouth, and Jehan roped him like a calf. He was
            cased all in that new-fangled armour which we call lizard-mail. Not rings like my
            hauberk here’—Sir Richard tapped his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chest—‘but
            little pieces of dagger-proof steel overlapping on stout leather. We stripped it off (no
            need to spoil good harness by wetting it), and in the neck-piece De Aquila found the
            same folden piece of parchment which we had put back under the hearthstone. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘At this Gilbert would have run out. I laid my hand on his shoulder. It sufficed. He
            fell to trembling and praying on his beads. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Gilbert,” said De Aquila, “here be more notable sayings and doings of our Lord of
            Pevensey for thee to write down. Take penner and inkhorn, Gilbert. We cannot all be
            Sacristans of Battle.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Said Fulke from the floor, “Ye have bound a King’s messenger. Pevensey shall burn for
            this!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Maybe. I have seen it besieged once,” said De Aquila, “but heart up, Fulke. I
            promise thee that thou shalt be hanged in the middle of the flames at the end of that
            siege, if I have to share my last loaf with thee; and that is more than Odo would have
            done when we starved out him and Mortain.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then Fulke sat up and looked long and cunningly at De Aquila. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“By the Saints,” said he, “why didst thou not say thou wast on the Duke’s side at the
            first?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Am I?” said De Aquila. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Fulke laughed and said, “No man who serves King Henry dare do this much to his
            messenger. When didst thou come over to the Duke? Let me up and we can smooth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it out together.” And he smiled and becked and winked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Yes, we will smooth it out,” said De Aquila. He nodded to me, and Jehan and I heaved
            up Fulke—he was a heavy man—and lowered him into the shaft by a rope, not so as to
            stand on our gold, but dangling by his shoulders a little above. It was turn of ebb, and
            the water came to his knees. He said nothing, but shivered somewhat. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then Jehan of a sudden beat down Gilbert’s wrist with his sheathed dagger, “Stop!” he
            said. “He swallows his beads.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Poison, belike,” said De Aquila. “It is good for men who know too much. I have
            carried it these thirty years. Give me!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then Gilbert wept and howled. De Aquila ran the beads through his fingers. The last
            one—I have said they were large nuts—opened in two halves on a pin, and there was a
            small folded parchment within. On it was written: “<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Old Dog goes to
              Salisbury to be beaten. I have his Kennel. Come quickly.</span></span>” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“This is worse than poison,” said De Aquila, very softly, and sucked in his cheeks.
            Then Gilbert grovelled in the rushes, and told us all he knew. The letter, as we
            guessed, was from Fulke to the Duke (and not the first that had passed between them);
            Fulke had given it to Gilbert in the chapel, and Gilbert thought to have taken it by
            morning to a certain fishing-boat at the wharf, which trafficked between Pevensey and
            the French shore. Gilbert was a false fellow, but he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>found time between his quakings and shakings to swear that the master of the boat knew
            nothing of the matter. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He hath called me shaved head,” said Gilbert, “and he hath thrown haddock-guts at
            me; but for all that, he is no traitor.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I will have no clerk of mine mishandled or miscalled,” said De Aquila. “That seaman
            shall be whipped at his own mast. Write me first a letter, and thou shalt bear it, with
            the order for the whipping, to-morrow to the boat.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘<span class="tei tei-corr">At</span> this Gilbert would have kissed De Aquila’s hand—he had not hoped to live until
            the morning—and when he trembled less he wrote a letter as from Fulke to the Duke
            saying that the Kennel, which signified Pevensey, was shut, and that the old Dog (which
            was De Aquila) sat outside it, and, moreover, that all had been betrayed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Write to any man that all is betrayed,” said De Aquila, “and even the Pope himself
            would sleep uneasily. Eh, Jehan? If one told thee all was betrayed, what wouldst thou
            do?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I would run away,” said Jehan. “It might be true.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Well said,” quoth De Aquila. “Write, Gilbert, that Montgomery, the great Earl, hath
            made his peace with the King, and that little D’Arcy, whom I hate, hath been hanged by
            the heels. We will give Robert full measure to chew upon. Write also that Fulke himself
            is sick to death of a dropsy.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Nay?” cried Fulke, hanging in the well-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shaft.
            “Drown me out of hand, but do not make a jest of me.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Jest? I?” said De Aquila. “I am but fighting for life and lands with a pen, as thou
            hast shown me, Fulke.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then Fulke groaned, for he was cold, and, “Let me confess,” said he. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Now, this is right neighbourly,” said De Aquila, leaning over the shaft. “Thou hast
            read my sayings and doings—or at least the first part of them—and thou art minded to
            repay me with thy own doings and sayings. Take penner and inkhorn, Gilbert. Here is work

            had no name for mercy to his men. Plunder he gave them, but pity, none. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Té! Té!” said De Aquila. “Thy treason was all confessed long ago by Gilbert. It

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Beyond belief,’ Sir Richard answered. ‘None the less, there was that in it which
            forced even Gilbert to laugh. We three laughed till we ached. At one place his teeth so
            chattered that we could not well hear, and we reached him down a cup of wine. Then he
            warmed to it, and smoothly set out all his shifts, malices, and treacheries, his extreme
            boldnesses (he was desperate bold); his retreats, shufflings, and counterfeitings (he
            was also inconceivably a coward); his lack of gear and honour; his despair at their
            loss; his remedies, and well-coloured contrivances. Yes, he waved the filthy rags of his
            life before us, as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>though they had been some proud
            banner. When he ceased, we saw by torches that the tide stood at the corners of his
            mouth, and he breathed strongly through his nose. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We had him out, and rubbed him; we wrapped him in a cloak, and gave him wine, and we
            leaned and looked upon him the while he drank. He was shivering, but shameless. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Of a sudden we heard Jehan at the stairway wake, but a boy pushed past him, and stood
            before us, the hall rushes in his hair, all slubbered with sleep. “My father! My father!
            I dreamed of treachery,” he cried, and babbled thickly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“There is no treachery here,” said Fulke. “Go,” and the boy turned, even then not
            fully awake, and Jehan led him by the hand to the Great Hall. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Thy only son!” said De Aquila, “Why didst thou bring the child here?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He is my heir. I dared not trust him to my brother,” said Fulke, and now he was
            ashamed. De Aquila said nothing, but sat weighing a wine cup in his two hands—thus.
            Anon, Fulke touched him on the knee. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Let the boy escape to Normandy,” said he, “and do with me at thy pleasure. Yea, hang
            me to-morrow, with my letter to Robert round my neck, but let the boy go.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Be still,” said De Aquila. “I think for England.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So we waited what our Lord of Pevensey should devise; and the sweat ran down Fulke’s
            forehead. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘At last said De Aquila: “I am too old to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>judge, or
            to trust any man. I do not covet thy lands, as thou hast coveted mine; and whether thou
            art any better or any worse than any other black Angevin thief, it is for thy King to
            find out. Therefore, go back to thy King, Fulke.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“And thou wilt say nothing of what has passed?” said Fulke. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Why should I? Thy son will stay with me. If the King calls me again to leave
            Pevensey, which I must guard against England’s enemies; if the King sends his men
            against me for a traitor; or if I hear that the King in his bed thinks any evil of me or
            my two knights, thy son will be hanged from out this window, Fulke.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But it hadn’t anything to do with his son,’ cried Una, startled. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How could we have hanged Fulke?’ said Sir Richard. ‘We needed him to make our peace
            with the King. He would have betrayed half England for the boy’s sake. Of that we were
            sure.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I don’t understand,’ said Una. ‘But I think it was simply awful.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So did not Fulke. He was well pleased.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What? Because his son was going to be killed?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay. Because De Aquila had shown him how he might save the boy’s life and his own
            lands and honours. “I will do it,” he said. “I swear I will do it. I will tell the King
            thou art no traitor, but the most excellent, valiant, and perfect of us all. Yes, I will
            save thee.” </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span>
          <a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘De Aquila looked still into the bottom of the cup, rolling the wine-dregs to and fro. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Ay,” he said. “If I had a son, I would, I think, save him. But do not by any means
            tell me how thou wilt go about it.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Nay, nay,” said Fulke, nodding his bald head wisely. “That is my secret. But rest at
            ease, De Aquila, no hair of thy head nor rood of thy land shall be forfeited,” and he
            smiled like one planning great good deeds. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“And henceforward,” said De Aquila, “I counsel thee to serve one master—not two.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What?” said Fulke. “Can I work no more honest trading between the two sides these
            troublous times?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Serve Robert or the King—England or Normandy,” said De Aquila. “I care not which it
            is, but make thy choice here and now.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“The King, then,” said Fulke, “for I see he is better served than Robert. Shall I
            swear it?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No need,” said De Aquila, and he laid his hand on the parchments which Gilbert had
            written. “It shall be some part of my Gilbert’s penance to copy out the savoury tale of
            thy life, till we have made ten, twenty, an hundred, maybe, copies. How many cattle,
            think you, would the Bishop of Tours give for that tale? Or thy brother? Or the Monks of
            Blois? Minstrels will turn it into songs which thy own Saxon serfs shall sing behind
            their plough-stilts, and men-at-arms riding through thy Norman towns. From here to Rome,
            Fulke, men will make very merry over <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that tale, and how
            Fulke told it, hanging in a well, like a drowned puppy. This shall be thy punishment, if
            ever I find thee double-dealing with thy King any more. Meantime, the parchments stay
            here with thy son. Him I will return to thee when thou hast made my peace with the King.
            The parchments never.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Fulke hid his face and groaned. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Bones of the Saints!” said De Aquila, laughing. “The pen cuts deep. I could never
            have fetched that grunt out of thee with any sword.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“But so long as I do not anger thee, my tale will be secret?” said Fulke. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Just so long. Does that comfort thee, Fulke?” said De Aquila. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What other comfort have ye left me?” he said, and of a sudden he wept hopelessly
            like a child, dropping his face on his knees.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Poor Fulke,’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I pitied him also,’ said Sir Richard. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“After the spur, corn,” said De Aquila, and he threw Fulke three wedges of gold that
            he had taken from our little chest by the bed-place. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“If I had known this,” said Fulke, catching his breath, “I would never have lifted
            hand against Pevensey. Only lack of this yellow stuff has made me so unlucky in my
            dealings.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It was dawn then, and they stirred in the Great Hall below. We sent down Fulke’s mail
            to be scoured, and when he rode away at noon under his own and the King’s banner very
            splendid and stately did he show. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>smoothed his long
            beard, and called his son to his stirrup and kissed him. De Aquila rode with him as far
            as the New Mill landward. We thought the night had been all a dream.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But did he make it right with the King?’ Dan asked. ‘About your not being traitors, I
            mean?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sir Richard smiled. ‘The King sent no second summons to Pevensey, nor did he ask why
            De Aquila had not obeyed the first. Yes, that was Fulke’s work. I know not how he did
            it, but it was well and swiftly done.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then you didn’t do anything to his son?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The boy? Oh, he was an imp. He turned the keep doors out of dortoirs while we had
            him. He sang foul songs, learned in the Barons’ camps—poor fool; he set the hounds
            fighting in hall; he lit the rushes to drive out, as he said, the fleas; he drew his
            dagger on Jehan, who threw him down the stairway for it; and he rode his horse through
            crops and among sheep. But when we had beaten him, and showed him wolf and deer, he
            followed us old men like a young, eager hound, and called us “uncle.” His father came
            the summer’s end to take him away, but the boy had no lust to go, because of the
            otter-hunting, and he stayed on till the fox-hunting. I gave him a bittern’s claw to
            bring him good luck at shooting. An imp, if ever there was!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And what happened to Gilbert?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Not even a whipping. De Aquila said he would sooner a clerk, however false, that knew
            the Manor-roll than a fool, however true, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that must be
            taught his work afresh. Moreover, after that night I think Gilbert loved as much as he
            feared De Aquila. At least he would not leave us—not even when Vivian, the King’s
            Clerk, would have made him Sacristan of Battle Abbey. A false fellow, but, in his
            fashion, bold.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Did Robert ever land in Pevensey after all?’ Dan went on. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We guarded the coast too well while Henry was fighting his Barons; and three or four
            years later, when England had peace, Henry crossed to Normandy and showed his brother
            some work at Tenchebrai that cured Robert of fighting. Many of Henry’s men sailed from
            Pevensey to that war. Fulke came, I remember, and we all four lay in the little chamber
            once again, and drank together. De Aquila was right. One should not judge men. Fulke was
            merry. Yes, always merry—with a catch in his breath.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And what did you do afterwards?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We talked together of times past. That is all men can do when they grow old, little
            maid.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The bell for tea rang faintly across the meadows. Dan lay in the bows of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golden Hind</span></span>; Una in the stern, the book of verses open in her lap,
            was reading from ‘The Slave’s Dream’:— </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan had come to grief over his Latin, and was kept in; so Una went alone to Far Wood.
            Dan’s big catapult and the lead bullets that Hobden had made for him were hidden in an
            old hollow beech-stub on the west of the wood. They had named the place out of the verse
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lays of Ancient Rome</span></span>. </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">From lordly Volaterrae,</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.00em">Where scowls the far-famed hold,</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Piled by the hands of giants</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.00em">For Godlike Kings of old.</div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They were the ‘Godlike Kings,’ and when old Hobden piled some comfortable brushwood
            between the big wooden knees of Volaterrae, they called him ‘Hands of Giants.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Una slipped through their private gap in the fence, and sat still a while, scowling as
            scowlily and lordlily as she knew how; for ‘Volaterrae’ is an important watch-tower that
            juts out of Far Wood just as Far Wood juts out of the hillside. Pook’s Hill lay below
            her, and all the turns of the brook as it wanders from out of the Willingford Woods,
            between hop-gardens, to old Hobden’s cottage at the Forge. The Sou’-West wind (there is
            always a wind by ‘Volaterrae’) blew from the bare ridge where Cherry Clack Windmill
            stands. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Now wind prowling through woods sounds like exciting things going to happen, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that is why on ‘blowy days’ you stand up in Volaterrae
            and shout bits of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lays</span></span> to suit its noises. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Una took Dan’s catapult from its secret place, and made ready to meet Lars Porsena’s
            army stealing through the wind-whitened aspens by the brook. A gust boomed up the
            valley, and Una chanted sorrowfully: </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">‘Verbenna down to Ostia</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.00em">Hath wasted all the plain;</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Astur hath stormed Janiculum</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.00em">And the stout guards are slain.’</div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the wind, not charging fair to the wood, started aside and shook a single oak in
            Gleason’s pasture. Here it made itself all small and crouched among the grasses, waving
            the tips of them as a cat waves the tip of her tail before she springs. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Now welcome—welcome Sextus,’ sang Una, loading the catapult— </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.00em">‘Now welcome to thy home,</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Why dost thou turn and run away?</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 2.00em">Here lies the rod of Rome.’</div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She fired into the face of the lull, to wake up the cowardly wind, and heard a grunt
            from behind a thorn in the pasture. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, my Winkie!’ she said aloud, and that was something she had picked up from Dan. ‘I
            believe I’ve tickled up a Gleason cow.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘You little painted beast!’ a voice cried. ‘I’ll teach you to sling your masters!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She looked down most cautiously, and saw a young man covered with hoopy bronze armour
            all glowing among the late broom. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>But what Una admired
            beyond all was his great bronze helmet with its red horse-tail that flicked in the wind.
            She could hear the long hairs rasp on his shimmery shoulder-plates. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What does the Faun mean,’ he said, half aloud to himself, ‘by telling me the Painted
            People have changed?’ He caught sight of Una’s yellow head. ‘Have you seen a painted
            lead-slinger?’ he called. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No-o,’ said Una. ‘But if you’ve seen a bullet——’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Seen?’ cried the man. ‘It passed within a hair’s breadth of my ear.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Well, that was me. I’m most awfully sorry.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Didn’t the Faun tell you I was coming?’ He smiled. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Not if you mean Puck. I thought you were a Gleason cow. I—I didn’t know you were
            a—a——What are you?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He laughed outright, showing a set of splendid teeth. His face and eyes were dark, and
            his eyebrows met above his big nose in one bushy black bar. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They call me Parnesius. I have been an officer of the Seventh Cohort of the Thirtieth
            Legion—the Ulpia Victrix. Did you sling that bullet?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I did. I was using Dan’s <span class="tei tei-corr">catapult,’</span> said <span class="tei tei-corr">Una.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Catapults!’ said he. ‘I ought to know something about them. Show me!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He leaped the rough fence with a rattle of spear, shield, and armour, and hoisted
            himself into ‘Volaterrae’ as <span class="tei tei-corr">quickly</span> as a shadow. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span>
          <a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A sling on a forked stick. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> understand!’ he cried, and pulled
            at the elastic. ‘But what wonderful beast yields this stretching leather?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It’s laccy—elastic. You put the bullet into that loop, and then you pull hard.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The man pulled, and hit himself square on his thumb-nail. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Each to his own weapon,’ he said, gravely, handing it back. ‘I am better with the
              <span class="tei tei-corr">bigger</span> machine, little maiden. But it’s a pretty toy. A
            wolf would laugh at it. Aren’t you afraid of wolves?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There aren’t any,’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Never believe it! A wolf is like a Winged Hat. He comes when he isn’t expected. Don’t
            they hunt wolves here?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We don’t hunt,’ said Una, remembering what she had heard from grown-ups. ‘We
            preserve—pheasants. Do you know them?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I ought to,’ said the young man, smiling again, and he imitated the cry of the
            cock-pheasant so perfectly that a bird answered out of the wood. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What a big painted clucking fool is a pheasant,’ he said. ‘Just like some Romans!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But you’re a Roman yourself, aren’t you?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ye-es and no. I’m one of a good few thousands who have never seen Rome except in a
            picture. My people have lived at Vectis for generations. Vectis! That island West yonder
            that you can see from so far in clear weather.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Do you mean the Isle of Wight? It lifts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>up just
            before rain, and we see it from the Downs.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Very likely. Our Villa’s on the South edge of the Island, by the Broken Cliffs. Most
            of it is three hundred years old, but the cow-stables, where our first ancestor lived,
            must be a hundred years older. Oh, quite that, because the founder of our family had his
            land given him by Agricola at the Settlement. It’s not a bad little place for its size.
            In spring-time violets grow down to the very beach. I’ve gathered sea-weeds for myself
            and violets for my Mother many a time with our old nurse.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Was your nurse a—a Romaness too?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No, a Numidian. Gods be good to her! A dear, fat, brown thing with a tongue like a
            cowbell. She was a free woman. By the way, are you free, maiden?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, quite,’ said Una. ‘At least, till tea-time; and in summer our governess doesn’t
            say much if we’re late.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The young man laughed again—a proper understanding laugh. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I see,’ said he. ‘That accounts for your being in the wood. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We</span></span>
            hid among the cliffs.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> have a governess, then?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Did we not? A Greek, too. She had a way of clutching her dress when she hunted us
            among the gorze-bushes that made us laugh. Then she’d say she’d get us whipped. She

            were thickheads, but my two brothers (I’m the middle one) liked those things, and, of
            course, Mother was clever enough for any six. She was nearly as tall as I am, and she
            looked like the new statue on the Western Road—the Demeter of the Baskets, you know.
            And funny! Roma Dea! How Mother could make us laugh!’ </p>

            said Una. ‘Tell me about all your family, please.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Good families are very much alike. Mother would sit spinning of evenings while Aglaia
            read in her corner, and Father did accounts, and we four romped about the passages. When
            our noise grew too loud the Pater would say, “Less tumult! Less tumult! Have you never
            heard of a Father’s right over his children? He can slay them, my loves—slay them dead,
            and the Gods highly approve of the action!” Then Mother would prim up her dear mouth
            over the wheel and answer: “H’m! I’m afraid there can’t be much of the Roman Father
            about you!” Then the Pater would roll up his accounts, and say, “I’ll show you!” and
            then—then, he’d be worse than any of us!’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes, and we visited our friends. There are no wolves in Vectis. We had many friends,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The young man looked astonished for a moment. ‘Aquae Solis,’ he repeated. ‘The best
            baths in Britain. Just as good, I’m told, as Rome. All the old gluttons sit in its hot
            water, and talk scandal and politics. And the Generals come through the streets with
            their guards behind them; and the magistrates come in their chairs with their stiff
            guards behind them; and you meet fortune-tellers, and goldsmiths, and merchants, and
            philosophers, and feather-sellers, and ultra-Roman Britons, and ultra-British Romans,
            and tame tribesmen pretending to be civilised, and Jew lecturers, and—oh, everybody
            interesting. We young people, of course, took no interest in politics. We had not the
            gout: there were many of our age like us. We did not find life sad. </p>

            who was always interested in plants and roots, met the First Doctor of a Legion from the
            City of the Legions, and he decided that he would be an Army doctor. I do not think it
            is a profession for a well-born man, but then—I’m not my brother. He went to Rome to
            study medicine, and now he’s First Doctor of a Legion in Egypt—at Antinoe, I think, but
            I have not heard from him for some time. </p>

            over her head, watching us climb the cliff-path from the boat. “Aie! Aie!” she said.
            “Children you went away. Men and a woman you return!” Then she kissed Mother, and Mother

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’m sorry. You must have pulled off too soon,’ said Dan. ‘Puck said you were telling

            them. ‘I will be chorus. Has he puzzled you much, Una?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Not a bit, except—I didn’t know where Ak—Ak something was,’ she answered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, Aquae Solis. That’s Bath, where the buns come from. Let the hero tell his own

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No. I went to my Father, and said I should like to enter the Dacian Horse (I had seen
            some at Aquae Solis); but he said I had better begin service in a regular Legion from
            Rome. Now, like many of our youngsters, I was not too fond of anything Roman. The
            Roman-born officers and magistrates looked down on us British-born as though we were
            barbarians. I told my Father so. </p>

            the outlying Provinces have set up from time to time. Which am I to follow?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Gratian,” said he. “At least he’s a sportsman.” </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“At Aquae Solis,” I said. It was perfectly true. This precious Emperor Gratian of
            ours had a bodyguard of fur-cloaked Scythians, and he was so crazy about them that he
            dressed like them. In Rome of all places in the world! It was as bad as if my own Father
            had painted <span class="tei tei-corr">himself</span> blue! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No matter for the clothes,” said the Pater. “They are only the fringe of the
            trouble. It began before your time or mine. Rome has forsaken her Gods, and must be
            punished. The great war with the Painted People broke out in the very year the temples
            of our Gods were destroyed. We beat the Painted People in the very year our temples were
            rebuilt. Go back further still.”... He went back to the time of Diocletian; and to
            listen to him you would have thought Eternal Rome herself was on the edge of
            destruction, just because a few people had become a little large-minded. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> knew nothing about it. Aglaia never <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>taught us the history of our own country. She was so full of her ancient
            Greeks. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“There is no hope for Rome,” said the Pater, at last. “She has forsaken her Gods, but
            if the Gods forgive <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></span> here, we may save Britain. To do that, we
            must keep the Painted People back. Therefore, I tell you, Parnesius, as a Father, that
            if your heart is set on service, your place is among men on the Wall—and not with women
            among the cities.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What Wall?’ asked Dan and Una at once. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Father meant the one we call Hadrian’s Wall. I’ll tell you about it later. It was
            built long ago, across North Britain, to keep out the Painted People—Picts you call
            them. Father had fought in the great Pict War that lasted more than twenty years, and he
            knew what fighting meant. Theodosius, one of our great Generals, had chased the little
            beasts back far into the North before I was born: down at Vectis, of course, we never
            troubled our heads about them. But when my Father spoke as he did, I kissed his hand,
            and waited for orders. We British-born Romans know what is due to our parents.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘If I kissed my Father’s hand, he’d laugh,’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Customs change; but if you do not obey your father, the Gods remember it. You may be
            quite sure of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘After our talk, seeing I was in earnest, the Pater sent me over to Clausentum to
            learn my foot-drill in a barrack full of foreign Auxiliaries—as unwashed and unshaved a
            mob <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of mixed barbarians as ever scrubbed a
            breast-plate. It was your stick in their stomachs and your shield in their faces to push
            them into any sort of formation. When I had learned my work the Instructor gave me a
            handful—and they were a handful!—of Gauls and Iberians to polish up till they were
            sent to their stations up-country. I did my best, and one night a villa in the suburbs
            caught fire, and I had my handful out and at work before any of the other troops. I
            noticed a quiet-looking man on the lawn, leaning on a stick. He watched us passing
            buckets from the pond, and at last he said to me: “Who are you?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“A probationer, waiting for a cohort,” I answered. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Yes, if you were born in Spain,” I said, for he neighed his words like an Iberian
            mule. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“And what might you call yourself when you are at home?” he said laughing. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“That depends,” I answered; “sometimes one thing and sometimes another. But now I’m

            had been Theodosius’s right hand in the Pict War! Not only had he given me my

            begins in the Tenth Cohort of his Legion, and works up.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And were you pleased?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Very. I thought Maximus had chosen me for my good looks and fine style in marching,
            but, when I went home, the Pater told me he had served under Maximus in the great Pict

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I was,’ said Parnesius. ‘Don’t begrudge it me, Faun. Afterwards—the Gods know I put
            aside the games!’ And Puck nodded, brown chin on brown hand, his big eyes still. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The night before I left we sacrificed to our ancestors—the usual little Home
            Sacrifice—but I never prayed so earnestly to all the Good Shades, and then I went with
            my Father by boat to Regnum, and across the chalk eastwards to Anderida yonder.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Regnum? Anderida?’ The children turned their faces to Puck. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Regnum’s Chichester,’ he said, pointing towards Cherry Clack, and—he threw his arm
            South behind him—‘Anderida’s Pevensey.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Pevensey again!’ said Dan. ‘Where Weland landed?’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The head-quarters of the Thirtieth lay at Anderida in summer, but my own Cohort, the
            Seventh, was on the Wall up North. Maximus was inspecting Auxiliaries—the Abulci, I
            think—at Anderida, and we stayed with him, for he and my Father were very old friends.
            I was only there ten days when I was ordered to go up with thirty men to my Cohort.’ He
            laughed merrily. ‘A man never forgets his first march. I was happier than any Emperor

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Parnesius smiled, and stood up, flashing in his armour. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So!’ said he; and he moved slowly through the beautiful movements of the Roman

            over with the butt of my spear, and explained to these Roman-born Romans that, if there
            were any further trouble, we should go on with one man short. And, by the Light of the

            for home. I found my men standing as they had been put—they had not even shifted their
            feet in the dust,—and off I marched, still feeling that terrific smile like an east
            wind up my back. I never halted them till sunset, and’—he turned about and looked at
            Pook’s Hill below him—‘then I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>halted yonder.’ He

            here and had a spear-head riveted. The forge was rented from the Government by a
            one-eyed smith from Carthage. I remember we called him <span class="tei tei-corr">Cyclops</span>. He sold me a beaver-skin rug for my sister’s room.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But it couldn’t have been here,’ Dan insisted. </p>

            tree trunks so that you could see red and gold and black deep into the heart of Far
            Wood; and Parnesius in his armour shone as though he had been afire. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Wait,’ he said, lifting a hand, and the sunlight jinked on his glass bracelet. ‘Wait!
            I pray to Mithras!’ </p>

            them, and we became friends. To tell the truth, they taught me the Roman Step. You see,
            I’d only served with quick-marching Auxiliaries. A Legion’s pace is altogether
            different. It is a long, slow stride, that never varies from sunrise to sunset. “Rome’s
            Race—Rome’s Pace,” as the proverb says. Twenty-four miles in eight hours, neither more
            nor less. Head and spear up, shield on your back, cuirass-collar open one hand’s
            breadth—and that’s how you take the Eagles through Britain.’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There are no adventures South the Wall,’ said Parnesius. ‘The worst thing that
            happened me was having to appear before a magistrate up North, where a wandering
            philosopher had jeered at the Eagles. I was able to show that the old man had
            deliberately blocked our road, and the magistrate told <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him, out of his own Book, I believe, that, whatever his God might be, he should pay

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did you do?’ said Dan. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Of course, the farther North you go the emptier are the roads. At last you fetch
            clear of the forests and climb bare hills, where wolves howl in the ruins of our cities
            that have been. No more pretty girls; no more jolly magistrates who knew your Father
            when he was young, and invite you to stay with them; no news at the temples and
            way-stations except bad news of wild beasts. There’s where you meet hunters, and
            trappers for the Circuses, prodding along chained bears and muzzled wolves. Your pony
            shies at them, and your men laugh. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The houses change from gardened villas to shut forts with watch-towers of grey stone,
            and great stone-walled sheepfolds, guarded by armed Britons of the North Shore. In the
            naked hills beyond the naked houses, where the shadows of the clouds play like cavalry
            charging, you see puffs of black smoke from the mines. The hard road goes on and on—and
            the wind sings through your helmet-plume—past altars to Legions and Generals forgotten,
            and broken statues of Gods and Heroes, and thousands of graves where the mountain foxes
            and hares peep at you. Red-hot in summer, freezing in winter, is that big, purple

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Is it just a Wall? Like the one round the kitchen-garden?’ said Dan. </p>

            guard-houses, small towers, between. Even on the narrowest part of it three men with
            shields can walk abreast from guard-house to guard-house. A little curtain wall, no
            higher than a man’s neck, runs along the top of the thick wall, so that from a distance
            you see the helmets of the sentries sliding back and forth like beads. Thirty feet high
            is the Wall, and on the Picts’ side, the North, is a ditch, strewn with blades of old
            swords and spear-heads set in wood, and tyres of wheels joined by chains. The Little
            People come there to steal iron for their arrow-heads. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But the Wall itself is not more wonderful than the town behind it. Long ago there
            were great ramparts and ditches on the South side, and no one was allowed to build <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>there. Now the ramparts are partly pulled down and built
            over, from end to end of the Wall; making a thin town eighty miles long. Think of it!
            One roaring, rioting, cockfighting, wolf-baiting, horse-racing town, from Ituna on the
            West to Segedunum on the cold eastern beach! On one side heather, woods and ruins where
            Picts hide, and on the other, a vast town—long like a snake, and wicked like a snake.
            Yes, a snake basking beside a warm wall! </p>

            into the Province of Valentia.’ Parnesius laughed scornfully. ‘The Province of Valentia!
            We followed the road, therefore, into Hunno town, and stood astonished. The place was a
            fair—a fair of peoples from every corner of the Empire. Some were racing horses: some
            sat in wine-shops: some watched dogs baiting bears, and many gathered in a ditch to see
            cocks fight. A boy not much older than myself, but I could see he was an Officer, reined
            up before me and asked what I wanted. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“My station,” I said, and showed him my shield.’ Parnesius held up his broad shield
            with its three X’s like letters on a beer-cask. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Lucky omen!” said he. “Your Cohort’s the next tower to us, but they’re all at the
            cock-fight. This is a happy place. Come and wet the Eagles.” He meant to offer me a
            drink. </p>

            interfere with your hopes. Go on to the Statue of Roma Dea. You can’t miss it. The main
            road into Valentia!” and he laughed and rode off. I could see the Statue not a quarter
            of a mile away, and there I went. At some time or other the Great North Road ran under
            it into Valentia; but the far end had been blocked up because of the Picts, and on the
            plaster a man had scratched, “Finish!” It was like marching into a cave. We grounded
            spears together, my little thirty, and it echoed in the barrel of the arch, but none
            came. There was a door at one side painted with our number. We prowled in, and I found a
            cook asleep, and ordered him to give us food. Then I climbed to the top of the Wall, and
            looked out over the Pict country, and I—thought,’ said Parnesius. ‘The bricked-up arch
            with “Finish!” on the plaster was what shook me, for I was not much more than a boy.’ </p>

            unhelmeted from the cock-fight, their birds under their arms, and asked me who I was?
            No, I was not happy; but I made my new Cohort unhappy too.... I wrote my Mother I was
            happy, but, oh, my friends’—he stretched arms over bare knees—‘I would not wish my
            worst enemy to suffer as I suf<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fered through my first
            months on the Wall. Remember this: among the officers was scarcely one, except myself
            (and I thought I had lost the favour of Maximus, my General), scarcely one who had not
            done something of wrong or folly. Either he had killed a man, or taken money, or
            insulted the magistrates, or blasphemed the Gods, and so had been sent to the Wall as a
            hiding-place from shame or fear. And the men were as the officers. Remember, also, that
            the Wall was manned by every breed and race in the Empire. No two towers spoke the same
            tongue, or worshipped the same Gods. In one thing only we were all equal. No matter what
            arms we had used before we came to the Wall, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">on</span></span> the Wall we were
            all archers, like the Scythians. The Pict cannot run away from the arrow, or crawl under
            it. He is a bowman himself. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></span> knows!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I suppose you were fighting Picts all the time,’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Picts seldom fight. I never saw a fighting Pict for half a year. The tame Picts told
            us they had all gone North.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What is a tame Pict?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A Pict—there were many such—who speaks a few words of our tongue, and slips across
            the Wall to sell ponies and wolf-hounds. Without a horse and a dog, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> a friend, man would perish. The Gods gave me all three, and there is no gift
            like friendship. Remember this’—Parnesius turned to Dan—‘when you become a young man.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I am not pious,’ Parnesius answered, ‘but I know what goodness means; and my friend,

            said so yourself.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He was the nephew, his Father had died, of a great rich man in Gaul who was not
            always kind to his Mother. When Pertinax grew up, he discovered this, and so his uncle
            shipped him off, by trickery and force, to the Wall. We came to know each other at a
            ceremony in our Temple—in the dark. It was the Bull Killing,’ Parnesius explained to
            Puck. </p>

            together.’ Parnesius lifted his hand towards his neck for an instant. ‘He had been on
            the Wall two years, and knew the Picts well. He taught me first how to take Heather.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What’s that?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Going out hunting in the Pict country with a tame Pict. You are quite safe so long as
            you are his guest, and wear a sprig of heather where it can be seen. If you went alone
            you would surely be killed, if you were not smothered first in the bogs. Only the Picts
            know their way about those black and hidden bogs. Old Allo, the one-eyed, withered
            little Pict from whom we bought our ponies, was our special friend. At first we went
            only to escape from the terrible town, and to talk together about our homes. Then he
            showed us how to hunt wolves and those great red deer with horns like Jewish
            candlesticks. The Roman-born officers rather looked down on us for doing this, but we
            preferred the heather to their amusements. Believe me,’ Parnesius turned again to Dan,
            ‘a boy is safe from all things that really harm when he is astride a pony or after a
            deer. Do you remember, O Faun,’ he turned to Puck, ‘the little altar I built to the
            Sylvan Pan by the pine-forest beyond the brook?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Which? The stone one with the line from Xenophon?’ said Puck, in quite a new voice. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No. What do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> know of Xenophon? That was Pertinax—after he
            had shot his first mountain-hare with an arrow—by chance! <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Mine I made of round pebbles in memory of my first bear. It took me one
            happy day to build.’ Parnesius faced the children quickly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And that was how we lived on the Wall for two years—a little scuffling with the
            Picts, and a great deal of hunting with old Allo in the Pict country. He called us his
            children sometimes, and we were fond of him and his barbarians, though we never let them
            paint us Pict fashion. The marks endure till you die.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How’s it done?’ said Dan. ‘Anything like tattooing?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They prick the skin till the blood runs, and rub in coloured juices. Allo was painted
            blue, green, and red from his forehead to his ankles. He said it was part of his
            religion. He told us about his religion (Pertinax was always interested in such things),
            and as we came to know him well, he told us what was happening in Britain behind the
            Wall. Many things took place behind us in those days. And, by the Light of the Sun,’
            said Parnesius, earnestly, ‘there was not much that those little people did not know! He
            told me when Maximus crossed over to Gaul, after he had made himself Emperor of Britain,
            and what troops and emigrants he had taken with him. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We</span></span> did not
            get the news on the Wall till fifteen days later. He told me what troops Maximus was
            taking out of Britain every month to help him to conquer Gaul; and I always found the
            numbers as he said. Wonderful! And I tell another strange thing!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He jointed his hands across his knees, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>leaned his
            head on the curve of the shield behind him. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Late in the summer, when the first frosts begin and the Picts kill their bees, we
            three rode out after wolf with some new hounds. Rutilianus, our General, had given us
            ten days’ leave, and we had pushed beyond the Second Wall—beyond the Province of
            Valentia—into the higher hills, where there are not even any of Rome’s old ruins. We
            killed a she-wolf before noon, and while Allo was skinning her he looked up and said to
            me, “When you are Captain of the Wall, my child, you won’t be able to do this any more!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I might as well have been made Prefect of Lower Gaul, so I laughed and said, “Wait
            till I am Captain.” “<span class="tei tei-corr">No, don’t</span> wait,” said Allo. “Take my advice and go home—both of
            you.” “We have no homes,” said Pertinax. “You know that as well as we do. We’re finished
            men—thumbs down against both of us. Only men without hope would risk their necks on
            your ponies.” The old man laughed one of those short Pict laughs—like a fox barking on
            a frosty night. “I’m fond of you two,” he said. “Besides, I’ve taught you what little
            you know about hunting. Take my advice and go home.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“We can’t,” I said. “I’m out of favour with my General, for one thing; and for
            another, Pertinax has an uncle.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I don’t know about his uncle,” said Allo, “but the trouble with you, Parnesius, is
            that your General thinks well of you.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Roma Dea!” said Pertinax, sitting <span class="tei tei-corr">up.</span>

            horse-coper?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Just then (you know how near the brutes creep when one is eating?) a great dog-wolf
            jumped out behind us, and away our rested hounds tore after him, with us at their tails.
            He ran us far out of any country we’d ever heard of, straight as an arrow till sunset,
            towards the sunset. We came at last to long capes stretching into winding waters, and on
            a grey beach below us we saw ships drawn up. Forty-seven we counted—not Roman galleys
            but the raven-winged ships from the North where Rome does not rule. Men moved in the
            ships, and the sun flashed on their helmets—winged helmets of the red-haired men from
            the North where Rome does not rule. We watched, and we counted, and we wondered; for
            though we had heard rumours concerning these Winged Hats, as the Picts called them,
            never before had we looked upon them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Come away! Come away!” said Allo. “My Heather won’t protect you here. We shall all
            be killed!” His legs trembled like his voice. Back we went—back across the heather
            under the moon, till it was nearly morning, and our poor beasts stumbled on some ruins. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When we woke, very stiff and cold, Allo was mixing the meal and water. One does not
            light fires in the Pict country except near a village. The little men are always
            signalling to each other with smokes, and a strange smoke brings them out buzzing like
            bees. They can sting, too! </p>

            trading-station.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I do not like lies on an empty stomach,” said Pertinax. “I suppose” (he had eyes
            like an eagle’s), “I suppose <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span> is a trading-station also?” He
            pointed to a smoke far off on a hill-top, ascending in what we call the Pict’s
            Call:—Puff—double-puff: double-puff—puff! They make it by raising and dropping a wet
            hide on a fire. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No,” said Allo, pushing the platter back into the bag. “That is for you and me. Your
            fate is fixed. Come.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We came. When one takes Heather, one must obey one’s Pict—but that wretched smoke
            was twenty miles distant, well over on the east coast, and the day was as hot as a bath. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Whatever happens,” said Allo, while our ponies grunted along, “I want you to
            remember me.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I shall not forget,” said Pertinax. “You have cheated me out of my breakfast.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What is a handful of crushed oats to a Roman?” he said. Then he laughed his laugh
            that was not a laugh. “What would you do if you were a handful of oats being crushed
            between the upper and lower stones of a mill?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I’m Pertinax, not a riddle-guesser,” said Pertinax. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“You’re a fool,” said Allo. “Your Gods and my Gods are threatened by strange Gods,
            and all you can do is to laugh.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Threatened men live long,” I said. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We climbed the last hot hill and looked out on the eastern sea, three or four miles
            off. There was a small sailing-galley of the North Gaul pattern at anchor, her
            landing-plank down and her sail half up; and below us, alone in a hollow, holding his
            pony, sat Maximus, Emperor of Britain! He was dressed like a hunter, and he leaned on
            his little stick; but I knew that back as far as I could see it, and I told Pertinax. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“You’re madder than Allo!” he said. “It must be the sun!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Maximus never stirred till we stood before him. Then he looked me up and down, and
            said: “Hungry again? It seems to be my destiny to feed you whenever we meet. I have food
            here. Allo shall cook it.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No,” said Allo. “A Prince in his own land does not wait on wandering Emperors. I
            feed my two children without asking your leave.” He began to blow up the ashes. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I was wrong,” said Pertinax. “We are all mad. Speak up, O Madman called Emperor!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Maximus smiled his terrible tight-lipped smile, but two years on the Wall do not make
            a man afraid of mere looks. So I was not afraid. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I meant you, Parnesius, to live and die an Officer of the Wall,” said Maximus. “But
            it seems from these,” he fumbled in his breast, “you can think as well as draw.” He
            pulled out a roll of letters I had written to my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>people, full of drawings of Picts, and bears, and men I had met on the Wall. Mother
            and my sister always liked my pictures. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He handed me one that I had called “Maximus’s Soldiers.” It showed a row of fat
            wine-skins, and our old Doctor of the Hunno hospital snuffing at them. Each time that
            Maximus had taken troops out of Britain to help him to conquer Gaul, he used to send the
            garrisons more wine—to keep them quiet, I suppose. On the Wall, we always called a
            wine-skin a “Maximus.” Oh, yes; and I had drawn them in Imperial helmets! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Not long since,” he went on, “men’s names were sent up to Cæsar for smaller jokes
            than this.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“True, Cæsar,” said Pertinax; “but you forget that was before I, your friend’s
            friend, became such a good spear-thrower.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He did not actually point his hunting spear at Maximus, but balanced it on his
            palm—so! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I was speaking of time past,” said Maximus, never fluttering an eyelid. “Nowadays
            one is only too pleased to find boys who can think for themselves, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> their friends.” He nodded at Pertinax. “Your Father lent me the letters,
            Parnesius, so you run no risk from me.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“None whatever,” said Pertinax, and rubbed the spear-point on his sleeve. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I have been forced to reduce the garrisons in Britain, because I need troops in
            Gaul. Now I come to take troops from the Wall itself,” said he. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I wish you joy of us,” said Pertinax. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>“We’re the

            criminals.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“You think so?” he said, quite seriously. “But it will only be till I win Gaul. One
            must always risk one’s life, or one’s soul, or one’s peace—or some little thing.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Allo passed round the fire with the sizzling deer’s meat. He served us two first. </p>

            you deserve it. They tell me you have quite a following among the Picts, Parnesius.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I have hunted with them,” I said. “Maybe I have a few friends among the Heather.” </p>

            a long speech about our virtues, and how we had saved one of his grandchildren from a
            wolf the year before.’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes; but that was neither here nor there. The little green man orated like a—like
            Cicero. He made us out to be magnificent fellows. Maximus never took his eyes off our

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Enough,” he said. “I have heard Allo on you. I wish to hear you on the Picts.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I told him as much as I knew, and Pertinax helped me out. There is never harm in a
            Pict if you but take the trouble to find out what he wants. Their real grievance against
            us came from our burning their heather. The whole garrison of the Wall moved out twice a
            year, and solemnly burned the heather for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ten miles
            North. Rutilianus, our General, called it clearing the country. The Picts, of course,
            scampered away, and all we did was to destroy their bee-bloom in the summer, and ruin
            their sheep-food in the spring. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“True, quite true,” said Allo. “How can we make our holy heather-wine, if you burn
            our bee-pasture?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We talked long, Maximus asking keen questions that showed he knew much and had
            thought more about the Picts. He said presently to me: “If I gave you the old Province
            of Valentia to govern, could you keep the Picts contented till I won Gaul? Stand away,
            so that you do not see Allo’s face; and speak your own <span class="tei tei-corr">thoughts.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No,” I said. “You cannot re-make that Province. The Picts have been free too long.” </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I also,” said Maximus, “or I should not be here.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Listen,” said Allo. “Long and long ago the Winged Hats”—he meant the
            Northmen—“came to our beaches and said, ‘Rome falls! Push her down!’ We fought you. You
            sent men. We were beaten. After <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that we said to the
            Winged Hats, ‘You are liars! Make our men alive that Rome killed, and we will believe
            you.’ They went away ashamed. Now they come back bold, and they tell the old tale, which
            we begin to believe—that Rome falls!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Give me three years’ peace on the Wall,” cried Maximus, “and I will show you and all
            the ravens how they lie!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Ah, I wish it too! I wish to save what is left of the corn from the millstones. But
            you shoot us Picts when we come to borrow a little iron from the Iron Ditch; you burn
            our heather, which is all our crop; you trouble us with your great catapults. Then you
            hide behind the Wall, and scorch us with Greek fire. How can I keep my young men from
            listening to the Winged Hats—in winter especially, when we are hungry? My young men
            will say, ‘Rome can neither fight nor rule. She is taking her men out of Britain. The
            Winged Hats will help us to push down the Wall. Let us show them the secret roads across
            the bogs.’ Do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> want that? No!” He spat like an adder. “<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> would keep the secrets of my people though I were burned alive.
            My two children here have spoken truth. Leave us Picts alone. Comfort us, and cherish
            us, and feed us from far off—with the hand behind your back. Parnesius understands us.
            Let <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></span> have rule on the Wall, and I will hold my young men quiet
            for”—he ticked it off on his fingers—“one year easily: the next year not so easily:
            the third year, perhaps! See, I give you three <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>years.
            If then you do not show us that Rome is strong in men and terrible in arms, the Winged
            Hats, I tell you, will sweep down the Wall from either sea till they meet in the middle,
            and you will go. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> shall not grieve over that, but well I know
            tribe never helps tribe except for one price. We Picts will go too. The Winged Hats will
            grind us to this!” He tossed a handful of dust in the air. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Oh, Roma Dea!” said Maximus, half aloud. “It is always one man’s work—always and
            everywhere!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“And one man’s life,” said Allo. “You are Emperor, but not a God. You may die.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I have thought of that, too,” said he. “Very good. If this wind holds, I shall be at
            the East end of the Wall by morning. To-morrow, then, I shall see you two when I
            inspect; and I will make you Captains of the Wall for this work.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“One instant, Cæsar,” said Pertinax. “All men have their price. I am not bought yet.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> also begin to bargain so early?” said Maximus. “Well?” </p>

            Write his name on these tablets—on the red side; the other is for the living!” And
            Maximus held out his tablets. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He is of no use to me dead,” said Pertinax. “My mother is a widow. I am far off. I

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We saw him grow small across the heather as he walked to the galley. There were
            Picts, scores, each side of him, hidden behind stones. He never looked left or right. He
            sailed away Southerly, full spread before the evening breeze, and when we had watched
            him out to sea, we were silent. We understood Earth bred few men like to this man. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Presently Allo brought the ponies and held them for us to mount—a thing he had never
            done before. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Wait awhile,” said Pertinax, and he made a little altar of cut turf, and strewed

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Parnesius stopped. The children sat still, not even asking if that were all the tale.
            Puck beckoned, and pointed the way out of the wood. <span class="tei tei-corr">‘Sorry,’</span> he whispered, ‘but you

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The next day happened to be what they called a Wild Afternoon. Father and Mother went
            out to pay calls; Miss Blake went for a ride on her bicycle, and they were left all
            alone till eight o’clock. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When they had seen their dear parents and their dear preceptress politely off the
            premises they got a cabbage-leaf full of raspberries from the gardener, and a Wild Tea
            from Ellen. They ate the raspberries to prevent their squashing, and they meant to
            divide the cabbage-leaf with Three Cows down at the Theatre, but they came across a dead
            hedgehog which they simply <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">had</span></span> to bury, and the leaf was too
            useful to waste. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then they went on to the Forge and found old Hobden the hedger at home with his son
            the Bee Boy who is not quite right in his head, but who can pick up swarms of bees in
            his naked hands; and the Bee Boy told them the rhyme about the slow-worm:— </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They all had tea together by the hives, and Hobden said the loaf-cake which Ellen had
            given them was almost as good as what his wife used to make, and he showed them how <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to set a wire at the right height for hares. They knew
            about rabbits already. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then they climbed up Long Ditch into the lower end of Far Wood. This is sadder and
            darker than the ‘Volaterrae’ end because of an old marlpit full of black water, where
            weepy, hairy moss hangs round the stumps of the willows and alders. But the birds come
            to perch on the dead branches, and Hobden says that the bitter willow-water is a sort of
            medicine for sick animals. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They sat down on a felled oak-trunk in the shadows of the beech undergrowth, and were
            looping the wires Hobden had given them, when they saw Parnesius. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘How quietly you came!’ said Una, moving up to make room. ‘Where’s Puck?’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He who makes himself Emperor anywhere must know everything, everywhere,’ said
            Parnesius. ‘We had this much from Maximus’ mouth after the Games.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Games? What games?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Parnesius stretched his arm out stiffly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thumb
            pointed to the ground. ‘Gladiators! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></span> sort of game,’ he said.
            ‘There were two days’ Games in his honour when he landed all unexpected at Segedunum on
            the East end of the Wall. Yes, the day after we had met him we held two days’ games; but
            I think the greatest risk was run, not by the poor wretches on the sand, but by Maximus.
            In the old days the Legions kept silence before their Emperor. So did not we! You could
            hear the solid roar run West along the Wall as his chair was carried rocking through the
            crowds. The garrison beat round him—clamouring, clowning, asking for pay, for change of
            quarters, for anything that came into their wild heads. That chair was like a little
            boat among waves, dipping and falling, but always rising again after one had shut the
            eyes.’ Parnesius shivered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Were they angry with him?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No more angry than wolves in a cage when their trainer walks among them. If he had
            turned his back an instant, or for an instant had ceased to hold their eyes, there would
            have been another Emperor made on the Wall that hour. Was it not so, Faun?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So it was. So it always will be,’ said Puck. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Late in the evening his messenger came for us, and we followed to the Temple of
            Victory, where he lodged with Rutilianus, the General of the Wall. I had hardly seen the
            General before, but he always gave me leave when I wished to take Heather. He was a
            great glutton, and kept five Asian cooks, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and he came
            of a family that believed in oracles. We could smell his good dinner when we entered,
            but the tables were empty. He lay snorting on a couch. Maximus sat apart among long
            rolls of accounts. Then the doors were shut. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“These are your men,” said Maximus to the General, who propped his eye-corners open
            with his gouty fingers, and stared at us like a fish. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I shall know them again, Cæsar,” said Rutilianus. </p>

            detachment after detachment of our best—of our least worthless men! He took two towers
            of our Scythians, two of our North British auxiliaries, two Numidian cohorts, the
            Dacians all, and half the Belgians. It was like an eagle pecking a carcass. </p>

            raw stone or forged bolts. Nothing can stand against them. He left us our catapults at
            last, but he took a Cæsar’s half of our men without pity. We were a shell when he rolled
            up the lists! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Hail, Cæsar! We, about to die, salute you!” said Pertinax, laughing. “If any enemy
            even leans against the Wall now, it will tumble.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Give me the three years Allo spoke of,” he answered, “and you shall have twenty
            thousand men of your own choosing up here. But now it is a gamble—a game played against
            the Gods, and the stakes are Britain, Gaul, and perhaps, Rome. You play on my side?” </p>

            We saw great Roma Dea atop of the Wall, the frost on her helmet, and her spear pointed
            towards the North Star. We saw the twinkle <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
            night-fires all along the guard-towers, and the line of the black catapults growing
            smaller and smaller in the distance. All these things we knew till we were weary; but
            that night they seemed very strange to us, because the next day we knew we were to be
            their masters. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The men took the news well; but when Maximus went away with half our strength, and we
            had to spread ourselves into the emptied towers, and the townspeople complained that
            trade would be ruined, and the Autumn gales blew—it was dark days for us two. Here
            Pertinax was more than my right hand. Being born and bred among the great country-houses
            in Gaul, he knew the proper words to address to all—from Roman-born Centurions to those
            dogs of the Third—the Libyans. And he spoke to each as though that man were as
            high-minded as himself. Now <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> saw so strongly what things were
            needed to be done, that I forgot things are only accomplished by means of men. That was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I feared nothing from the Picts, at least for that year, but Allo warned me that the
            Winged Hats would soon come in from the sea at each end of the Wall to prove to the
            Picts how weak we were. So I made ready in haste, and none too soon. I shifted our best
            men to the ends of the Wall, and set up screened catapults by the beach. The Winged Hats
            would drive in before the snow-squalls—ten or twenty boats at a time—on Segedunum or
            Ituna, according as the wind blew. </p>

            If you wait till you see her men gather up the sail’s foot, your catapults can jerk a
            net of loose stones (bolts only cut through the cloth) into the bag of it. Then she
            turns over, and the sea makes everything clean again. A few men may come ashore, but
            very few.... It was not hard work, except the waiting on the beach in blowing sand and
            snow. And that was how we dealt with the Winged Hats that winter. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Early in the Spring, when the East winds blow like skinning-knives, they gathered
            again off the East end with many ships. Allo told me they would never rest till they had
            taken a tower in open fight. Certainly they fought in the open. We dealt with them
            thoroughly through a long day: and when all was finished, one man dived clear of the
            wreckage of his ship, and swam towards shore. I waited, and a wave tumbled him at my
            feet. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘As I stooped, I saw he wore such a medal as I wear.’ Parnesius raised his hand to his
            neck. ‘Therefore, when he could speak, I addressed him a certain Question which can only
            be answered in a certain manner. He answered with the necessary Word—the Word that
            belongs to the Degree of Gryphons in the science of Mithras my God. I put my shield over
            him till he could stand up. You see I am not short, but he was a head taller than I. He
            said: “What now?” I said: “At your pleasure, my brother, to stay or go.” </p>

            She came as a hound comes to a master. When she was yet a hundred paces from the beach,
            he flung back his hair, and swam out. They hauled him in, and went away. I knew that
            those who worship Mithras are many and of all races, so I did not think much more upon
            the matter. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A month later I saw Allo with his horses—by the Temple of Pan, O Faun!—and he gave

            Rutilianus. “Nay,” said Allo. “This is a gift from Amal, that Winged Hat whom you saved
            on the beach. He says you are a <span class="tei tei-corr">Man.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“He is a Man, too. Tell him I can wear his gift,” I answered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Oh, Amal is a young fool; but, speaking as sensible men, your Emperor is doing such
            great things in Gaul that the Winged Hats are anxious to be his friends, or, better
            still, the friends of his servants. They think you and Pertinax could lead them to
            victories.” Allo looked at me like a one-eyed raven. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Allo,” I said, “you are the corn between the two millstones. Be content if they
            grind evenly, and don’t thrust your hand between them.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I?” said Allo. “I hate Rome and the Winged Hats equally; but if the Winged Hats
            thought that some day you and Pertinax might join them against Maximus, they would leave
            you in peace while you considered. Time is what we need—you and I and Maxi<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mus. Let me carry a pleasant message back to the Winged
            Hats—something for them to make a council over. We barbarians are all alike. We sit up
            half the night to discuss anything a Roman says. Eh?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“We have no men. We must fight with words,” said Pertinax. “Leave it to Allo and me.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So Allo carried word back to the Winged Hats that we would not fight them if they did
            not fight us; and they (I think they were a little tired of losing men in the sea)
            agreed to a sort of truce. I believe Allo, who being a horse-dealer loved lies, also
            told them we might some day rise against Maximus as Maximus had risen against Rome. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Indeed, they permitted the corn-ships which I sent to the Picts to pass North that
            season without harm. Therefore the Picts were well fed that winter, and since they were
            in some sort my children, I was glad of it. We had only two thousand men on the Wall,
            and I wrote many times to Maximus and begged—prayed—him to send me only one cohort of
            my old North British troops. He could not spare them. He needed them to win more
            victories in Gaul. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then came news that he had defeated and slain the Emperor Gratian, and thinking he
            must now be secure, I wrote again for men. He answered: “You will learn that I have at
            last settled accounts with the pup Gratian. There was no need that he should have died,
            but he became confused and lost his head, which is a bad thing to befall any Emperor.

            the men you need. Just now I can spare none.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did he mean by his General’s son?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He meant Theodosius Emperor of Rome, who was the son of Theodosius the General under
            whom Maximus had fought in the old Pict War. The two men never loved each other, and
            when Gratian made the younger Theodosius Emperor of the East (at least, so I’ve heard),
            Maximus carried on the war to the second generation. It was his fate, and it was his
            fall. But Theodosius the Emperor is a good man. As I know.’ Parnesius was silent for a
            moment and then continued. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I wrote back to Maximus that, though we had peace on the Wall, I should be happier
            with a few more men and some new catapults. He answered: “You must live a little longer
            under the shadow of my victories, till I can see what young Theodosius intends. He may
            welcome me as a brother-Emperor, or he may be preparing an army. In either case I cannot
            spare men just now.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But he was always saying that,’ cried Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It was true. He did not make excuses; but thanks, as he said, to the news of his
            victories, we had no trouble on the Wall for a long, long time. The Picts grew fat as
            their own sheep among the heather, and as many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of my
            men as lived were well exercised in their weapons. Yes, the Wall looked strong. For
            myself, I knew how weak we were. I knew that if even a false rumour of any defeat to
            Maximus broke loose among the Winged Hats, they might come down in earnest, and
            then—the Wall must go! For the Picts I never cared, but in those years I learned
            something of the strength of the Winged Hats. They increased their strength every day,
            but I could not increase my men. Maximus had emptied Britain behind us, and I felt
            myself to be a man with a rotten stick standing before a broken fence to turn bulls. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Thus, my friends, we lived on the Wall, waiting—waiting—waiting for the men that

              shall have Britain to rule, and Pertinax, if he chooses, Gaul. To-day I wish strongly
              you were with me to beat my Auxiliaries into shape. Do not, I pray you, believe any
              rumour of my sickness. I have a little evil in my old body which I shall cure by

            fair-haired man, half frozen, bound to some broken planks. Turning him over, we saw by
            his belt-buckle that he was a Goth of an Eastern Legion. Suddenly he opened his eyes and
            cried loudly: “He is dead! The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>letters were with me,

            our faces what we had heard. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“It was in a tent by the Sea,” he stammered. “He was beheaded by Theodosius. He sent
            a letter to you, written while he waited to be slain. The Winged Hats met the ship and
            took it. The news is running through the heather like fire. Blame me not! I cannot hold
            back my young men any more.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I would we could say as much for our men,” said Pertinax, laughing. “But, Gods be
            praised, they cannot run away.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What do you do?” said Allo. “I bring an order—a message—from the Winged Hats that
            you join them with your men, and march South to plunder Britain.” </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Alas! my poor barbarian,” said Pertinax, still laughing. “Well, you have sold us too
            many good ponies to be thrown back to your friends. We will make you a prisoner,

            rope. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No,” I said. “Time may help. If Maximus wrote us letters while he was a prisoner,
            Theodosius must have sent the ship that brought it. If he can send ships, he can send
            men.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“How will that profit us?” said Pertinax. “We serve Maximus, not Theodosius. Even if
            by some miracle of the Gods Theodosius down South sent and saved the Wall, we could not
            expect more than the death Maximus died.” </p>

            Maximus’s death which might bring down the Winged Hats, but we were sure, even if it
            were true, that Theodosius, for the sake of Britain, would send us help. Therefore, we
            must stand fast.... My friends, it is above all things strange to see how men bear ill
            news! Often the strongest till then become the weakest, while the weakest, as it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were, reach up and steal strength from the Gods. So it
            was with us. Yet my Pertinax by his jests and his courtesy and his labours had put heart
            and training into our poor numbers during the past years—more than I should have
            thought possible. Even our Libyan Cohort—the Thirds—stood up in their padded cuirasses
            and did not whimper. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘In three days came seven chiefs and elders of the Winged Hats. Among them was that
            tall young man, Amal, whom I had met on the beach, and he smiled when he saw my
            necklace. We made them welcome, for they were ambassadors. We showed them Allo, alive
            but bound. They thought we had killed him, and I saw it would not have vexed them if we
            had. Allo saw it too, and it vexed him. Then in our quarters at Hunno we came to
            Council. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They said that Rome was falling, and that we must join them. They offered me all
            South Britain to govern after they had taken a tribute out of it. </p>

            shall have his proof.” He threw across to me a letter (well I knew the seal) from

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Read!” said Amal. “Read, and then let us hear whose servants you are!” </p>

              prophesied. The naked swords wait at the tent door to give me the death I gave to
              Gratian. Therefore I, your General and your Emperor, send you free and honourable

            been mistaken in his servants!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And Pertinax read on: “<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You gave me the time for which I asked. If I
              have failed to use it, do not lament. We have gambled very splendidly against the
              Gods, but they hold weighted dice, and I must pay the forfeit. Remember, I have been;
              but Rome is; and Rome will be! Tell Pertinax his Mother is in safety at Nicæa, and her
              monies are in charge of the Prefect at Antipolis. Make my remembrances to your Father
              and to your Mother, whose friendship was great gain to me. Give also to my little
              Picts and to the Winged Hats such messages as their thick heads can understand. I
              would have sent you three Legions this very day if all had gone aright. Do not forget

            over the sword. I am glad of it.” He held out his hand to me. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“But Maximus has given you your dismissal,” said an elder. “You are certainly free to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“We thank you,” said Pertinax. “But Maximus tells us to give you such messages as<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>—pardon me, but I use his words—your thick heads can

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“We understand,” said an elder. “The Wall must be won at a price?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“It grieves me,” said Pertinax, laughing, “but so it must be won,” and he gave them

            wonder what the ravens and the dogfish will make of some of us before this snow melts.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Think rather what Theodosius may send,” I answered; and though they laughed, I saw
            that my chance shot troubled them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Only old Allo lingered behind a little. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“You see,” he said, winking and blinking, “I am no more than their dog. When I have
            shown their men the secret short ways across our bogs, they will kick me like one.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Then I should not be in haste to show them those ways,” said Pertinax, “till I were
            sure that Rome could not save the Wall.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“You think so? Woe is me!” said the old man. “I only wanted peace for my people,” and
            he went out stumbling through the snow behind the tall Winged Hats. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘In this fashion then, slowly, a day at a time, which is very bad for doubting troops,
            the War came upon us. At first the Winged Hats swept in from the sea as they had done
            before, and there we met them as before—with the catapults; and they sickened of it.
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Yet for a long time they would not trust their
            duck-legs on land, and I think when it came to revealing the secrets of the tribe, the
            little Picts were afraid or ashamed to show them all the roads across the heather. I had
            this from a Pict prisoner. They were as much our spies as our enemies, for the Winged
            Hats oppressed them, and took their winter stores. Ah, foolish Little People! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then the Winged Hats began to roll us up from each end of the Wall. I sent runners
            Southward to see what the news might be in Britain; but the wolves were very bold that
            winter among the deserted stations where the troops had once been, and none came back.
            We had trouble too with the forage for the ponies along the Wall. I kept ten, and so did
            Pertinax. We lived and slept in the saddle riding east or west, and we ate our worn-out
            ponies. The people of the town also made us some trouble till I gathered them all in one
            quarter behind Hunno. We broke down the Wall on either side of it to make as it were a
            citadel. Our men fought better in close order. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘By the end of the second month we were deep in the War as a man is deep in a
            snow-drift or in a dream. I think we fought in our sleep. At least I know I have gone on
            the Wall and come off again, remembering nothing between, though my throat was harsh
            with giving orders, and my sword, I could see, had been used. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The Winged Hats fought like wolves—all in a pack. Where they had suffered most, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>there they charged in most hotly. This was hard for the
            defender, but it held them from sweeping on into Britain. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘In those days Pertinax and I wrote on the plaster of the bricked archway into
            Valentia the names of the towers, and the days on which they fell one by one. We wished
            for some record. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And the fighting? The fight was always hottest to left and right of the great Statue
            of Roma Dea, near to Rutilianus’ house. By the light of the Sun, that old fat man, whom
            we had not considered at all, grew young again among the trumpets! I remember he said
            his sword was an oracle! “Let us consult the Oracle,” he would say, and put the handle
            against his ear, and shake his head wisely. “And <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></span> day is
            allowed Rutilianus to live,” he would say, and, tucking up his cloak, he would puff and
            pant and fight well. Oh, there were jests in plenty on the Wall to take the place of
            food! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We endured for two months and seventeen days—always being pressed from three sides
            into a smaller space. Several times Allo sent in word that help was at hand. We did not
            believe it, but it cheered our men. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The end came not with shoutings of joy, but, like the rest, as in a dream. The Winged
            Hats suddenly left us in peace for one night, and the next day; which is too long for
            spent men. We slept at first lightly, expecting to be roused, and then like logs, each
            where he lay. May you never need such sleep! When I waked our towers were full of
            strange, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>armed men, who watched us snoring. I roused
            Pertinax, and we leaped up together. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“What?” said a young man in clean armour. “Do you fight against Theodosius? Look!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘North we looked over the red snow. No Winged Hats were there. South we looked over
            the white snow, and behold there were the Eagles of two strong Legions encamped. East
            and west we saw flame and fighting, but by Hunno all was still. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Trouble no more,” said the young man. “Rome’s arm is long. Where are the Captains of
            the Wall?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We said we were those men. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“But you are old and grey-haired,” he cried. “Maximus said that they were boys.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Yes that was true some years ago,” said Pertinax. “What is our fate to be, you fine
            and well-fed child?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I am called Ambrosius, a secretary of the Emperor,” he answered. “Show me a certain

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I took it from my breast, and when he had read it he saluted us, saying: “Your fate
            is in your own hands. If you choose to serve Theodosius, he will give you a Legion. If

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I would like better a bath, wine, food, razors, soaps, oils, and scents,” said

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A rainy afternoon drove Dan and Una over to play pirates in the Little Mill. If you
            don’t mind rats on the rafters and oats in your shoes, the mill-attic, with its
            trap-doors and inscriptions on beams about floods and sweethearts, is a splendid place.
            It is lighted by a foot-square window, called Duck Window, that looks across to Little
            Lindens Farm, and the spot where Jack Cade was killed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When they had climbed the attic ladder (they called it the ‘mainmast tree’ out of the
            ballad of Sir Andrew Barton, and Dan ‘swarved it with might and main,’ as the ballad
            says) they saw a man sitting on Duck window-sill. He was dressed in a plum-coloured
            doublet and tight plum-coloured hose, and he drew busily in a red-edged book. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Sit ye! Sit ye!’ Puck cried from a rafter overhead. ‘See what it is to be beautiful!
            Sir Harry Dawe—pardon, Hal—says I am the very image of a head for a gargoyle.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The man laughed and raised his dark velvet cap to the children, and his grizzled hair
            bristled out in a stormy fringe. He was old—forty at least—but his eyes were young,
            with funny little wrinkles all round them. A satchel of embroidered leather hung from
            his broad belt, which looked interesting. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span>
          <a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘May we see?’ said Una, coming forward. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Surely—sure-ly!’ he said, moving up on the window-seat, and returned to his work
            with a silver-pointed pencil. Puck sat as though the grin were fixed for ever on his
            broad face, while they watched the quick, certain fingers that copied it. Presently the
            man took a reed pen from his satchel, and trimmed it with a little ivory knife, carved
            in the semblance of a fish. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, what a beauty!’ cried Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘’Ware fingers! That blade is perilous sharp. I made it myself of the best Low Country
            cross-bow steel. And so, too, this fish. When his back-fin travels to his tail—so—he
            swallows up the blade, even as the whale swallowed Gaffer Jonah.... Yes, and that’s my
            ink-horn. I made the four silver saints round it. Press Barnabas’s head. It opens, and
            then——’ He dipped the trimmed pen, and with careful boldness began to put in the
            essential lines of Puck’s rugged face, that had been but faintly revealed by the
            silver-point. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The children gasped, for it fairly leaped from the page. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As he worked, and the rain fell on the tiles, he talked—now clearly, now muttering,
            now breaking off to frown or smile at his work. He told them he was born at Little
            Lindens Farms, and his father used to beat him for drawing things instead of doing
            things, till an old priest called Father Roger, who drew illuminated letters in rich
            people’s books, coaxed the parents to let him take the boy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as a sort of painter’s apprentice. Then he went with Father Roger to
            Oxford, where he cleaned plates and carried cloaks and shoes for the scholars of a
            College called Merton. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Didn’t you hate that?’ said Dan after a great many other questions. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I never thought on’t. Half Oxford was building new colleges or beautifying the old,
            and she had called to her aid the master-craftsmen of all Christendie—kings in their
            trade and honoured of Kings. I knew them. I worked for them: that was enough. No
            wonder——’ He stopped and laughed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘You became a great man,’ said Puck. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They said so, Robin. Even Bramante said so.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why? What did you do?’ Dan asked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The artist looked at him queerly. ‘Things in stone and such, up and down England. You
            would not have heard of ’em. To come nearer home, I re-builded this little St.
            Bartholomew’s church of ours. It cost me more trouble and sorrow than aught I’ve touched
            in my life. But ’twas a sound lesson.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Um,’ said Dan. ‘We had lessons this morning.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’ll not afflict ye, lad,’ said Hal, while Puck roared. ‘Only ’tis strange to think
            how that little church was re-built, re-roofed, and made glorious, thanks to some few
            godly Sussex iron-masters, a Bristol sailor lad, a proud ass called Hal o’ the Draft
            because, d’you see, he was always drawing and drafting; and’—he dragged the words
              slowly—‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> a Scotch pirate.’ </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span>
          <a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Pirate?’ said Dan. He wriggled like a hooked fish. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Even that Andrew Barton you were singing of on the stair just now.’ He dipped again
            in the ink-well, and held his breath over a sweeping line, as though he had forgotten
            everything else. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Pirates don’t build churches, do they?’ said Dan. ‘Or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span>
            they?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They help mightily,’ Hal laughed. ‘But you were at your lessons this morn, Jack
            Scholar?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, pirates aren’t lessons. It was only Bruce and his silly old spider,’ said Una.
            ‘Why did Sir Andrew Barton help you?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I question if he ever knew it,’ said Hal, twinkling. ‘Robin, how a-mischief’s name am
            I to tell these innocents what comes of sinful pride?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, we know all about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>,’ said Una pertly. ‘If you get too
            beany—that’s cheeky—you get sat upon, of course.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hal considered a moment, pen in air, and Puck said some long words. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Aha! That was my case too,’ he cried. ‘Beany—you say—but certainly I did not
            conduct myself well. I was proud of—of such things as porches—a Galilee porch at
            Lincoln for choice—proud of one Torrigiano’s arm on my shoulder, proud of my knighthood
            when I made the gilt scroll-work for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Sovereign</span></span>—our King’s
            ship. But Father Roger sitting in Merton Library, he did not forget me. At the top of my
            pride, when I and no other should have builded the porch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at Lincoln, he laid it on me with a terrible forefinger to go back to my Sussex clays
            and re-build, at my own charges, my own church, where we Dawes have been buried for six
            generations. “Out! Son of my Art!” said he. “Fight the Devil at home ere you call

            flourished the finished sketch before Puck. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Me! Me past peradventure,’ said Puck, smirking like a man at a mirror. ‘Ah, see! The
            rain has took off! I hate housen in daylight.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Whoop! Holiday!’ cried Hal, leaping up. ‘Who’s for my Little Lindens? We can talk
            there.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They tumbled downstairs, and turned past the dripping willows by the sunny mill dam. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Body o’ me,’ said Hal, staring at the hop-garden, where the hops were just ready to
            blossom. ‘What are these vines? No, not vines, and they twine the wrong way to beans.’
            He began to draw in his ready book. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Hops. New since your day,’ said Puck. ‘They’re an herb of Mars, and their flowers

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Heresy I know. I’ve seen Hops—God be praised for their beauty! What is your Turkis?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The children laughed. They knew the Lindens turkeys, and as soon as they reached <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Lindens’ orchard on the hill the flock charged at them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Out came Hal’s book at once. ‘Hoity-toity!’ he cried. ‘Here’s Pride in purple
            feathers! Here’s wrathy contempt and the Pomps of the Flesh! How d’you call <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></span>?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Turkeys! Turkeys!’ the children shouted, as the old gobbler raved and flamed against
            Hal’s plum-coloured hose. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Save Your Magnificence!’ he said. ‘I’ve drafted two good new things to-day.’ And he
            doffed his cap to the bubbling bird. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then they walked through the grass to the knoll where Little Lindens stands. The old
            farm-house, weather-tiled to the ground, took almost the colour of a blood-ruby in the
            afternoon light. The pigeons pecked at the mortar in the chimney-stacks; the bees that
            had lived under the tiles since it was built filled the hot August air with their
            booming; and the smell of the box-tree by the dairy-window mixed with the smell of earth
            after rain, bread after baking, and a tickle of wood-smoke. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The farmer’s wife came to the door, baby on arm, shaded her brows against the sun,
            stooped to pluck a sprig of rosemary, and turned down the orchard. The old spaniel in
            his barrel barked once or twice to show he was in charge of the empty house. Puck
            clicked back the garden-gate. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘D’you marvel that I love it?’ said Hal, in a whisper. ‘What can town folk know of the

            fern-covered dimples and hollows of the Forge behind Hobden’s cottage. The old man was
            cutting a faggot in his garden by the hives. It was quite a second after his chopper
            fell that the chump of the blow reached their lazy ears. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Eh—yeh!’ said Hal. ‘I mind when where that old gaffer stands was Nether

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did they make?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Guns for the King’s ships—and for others. Serpentines and cannon mostly. When the
            guns were cast, down would come the King’s Officers, and take our plough-oxen to haul
            them to the coast. Look! Here’s one of the first and finest craftsmen of the Sea!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He fluttered back a page of his book, and showed them a young man’s head. Underneath
            was written: ‘Sebastianus.’ </p>

            ships. I drafted him thus sitting by our fire telling Mother of the new lands he’d find
            the far side the world. And he found them, too! There’s a nose to cleave through unknown
            seas! Cabot was his name—a Bristol lad—half a foreigner. I set a heap by him. He
            helped me to my church-building.’ </p>

            of it. I had come down here, not to serve God as a craftsman should, but to show my
            people how great a craftsman I was. They cared not, and it served me right, one split
            straw for my craft or my greatness. What a murrain call had I, they said, to mell with
            old St. Barnabas’s? Ruinous the church had been since the Black Death, and ruinous she
            should remain; and I could hang myself in my new scaffold-ropes! Gentle and simple, high
            and low—the Hayes, the Fowles, the Fanners, the Collinses—they were all in a tale
            against me. Only Sir John Pelham up yonder to Brightling bade me heart-up and go on. Yet
            how could I? Did I ask Master Collins for his timber-tug to haul beams? The oxen had
            gone to Lewes after <span class="tei tei-corr">lime.</span> Did he promise me a set of iron cramps
            or ties for the roof? They never came to hand, or else they were spaulty or cracked. So
            with everything. Nothing said, but naught done except I stood by them, and then done
            amiss. I thought the countryside was fair bewitched.’ </p>

            tricks as he’d played me with my ironwork. Week in, week out, two of three serpentines
            would be flawed in the casting, and only fit, they said, to be remelted. Then John
            Collins would shake his head, and vow he could pass no cannon for the King’s service
            that were not perfect. Saints! How Sebastian stormed! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> know, for

            Dirk Brenzett, Master of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cygnet</span></span> hoy, sends me word that the
            block of stone he was fetching me from France for our new font he’d hove overboard to
            lighten his ship, chased by Andrew Barton up to Rye Port.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ah! The pirate!’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes. And while I am tearing my hair over this, Ticehurst Will, my best mason, comes
            to me shaking, and vowing that the Devil, horned, tailed, and chained, has run out on
            him from the church-tower, and the men would work there no more. So I took ’em off the
            foundations, which we were strengthening, and went into the Bell Tavern for a cup of
            ale. Says Master John Collins: “Have it your own way, lad; but if I was you, I’d take
            the sinnification o’ the sign, and leave old Barnabas’s Church alone!” And they all
            wagged their sinful heads, and agreed. Less afraid of the Devil than of me—as I saw

            were to be taken,” says Sebastian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Words! Words only,” says Sir John. “Master Collins is somewhat of a liar at best.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He carried it so gravely, that for the moment, I thought he was dipped in this secret
            traffick too, and that there was not an honest ironmaster in Sussex. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Name o’ Reason!” says Sebastian, and raps with his cow-tail on the table, “Whose
            guns are they, then?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Yours, manifestly,” says Sir John. “You come with the King’s Order for ’em, and
            Master Collins casts them in his foundry. If he chooses to bring them up from Nether
            Forge and lay ’em out in the church tower, why they are e’en so much the nearer to the
            main road and you are saved a day’s hauling. What a coil to make of a mere act of
            neighbourly kindness, lad!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I fear I have requited him very scurvily,” says Sebastian, looking at his knuckles.
            “But what of the demi-cannon? I could do with ’em well, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></span>
            are not in the King’s Order.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Kindness—loving-kindness,” says Sir John. “Questionless, in his zeal for the King
            and his love for you, John adds those two <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cannon as a
            gift. ’Tis plain as this coming daylight, ye stockfish!” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“So it is,” says Sebastian. “Oh, Sir John, Sir John, why did you never use the sea?
            You are lost ashore.” And he looked on him with great love. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I do my best in my station.” Sir John strokes his beard again and rolls forth his
            deep drumming Justice’s voice thus:—“But—suffer me!—you two lads, on some midnight
            frolic into which I probe not, roystering around the taverns, surprise Master Collins at
            his”—he thinks a moment—“at his good deeds done by stealth. Ye surprise him, I say,
            cruelly.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Truth, Sir John. If you had seen him run!” says Sebastian. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“On this you ride breakneck to me with a tale of pirates, and wool-wains, and
            cow-hides, which, though it hath moved my mirth as a man, offendeth my reason as a
            magistrate. So I will e’en accompany you back to the tower with, perhaps, some few of my
            own people, and three to four wagons, and I’ll be your warrant that Master John Collins
            will freely give you your guns and your demi-cannon, Master Sebastian.” He breaks into
            his proper voice—“I warned the old tod and his neighbours long ago that they’d come to
            trouble with their side-sellings and bye-dealings; but we cannot have half Sussex hanged
            for a little gun-running. Are ye content, lads?” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I’d commit any treason for two demi-cannon,” said Sebastian, and rubs his hands. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Ye have just compounded with rank treason-felony for the same bribe,” says Sir John.
            “Wherefore to horse, and get the guns.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But Master Collins meant the guns for Sir Andrew Barton all along, didn’t he?’ said
            Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Questionless, that he did,’ said Hal. ‘But he lost them. We poured into the village
            on the red edge of dawn, Sir John horsed, in half-armour, his pennon flying; behind him
            thirty stout Brightling knaves, five abreast; behind them four wool-wains, and behind
            them four trumpets to triumph over the jest, blowing: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Our King went
              forth to Normandie</span></span>. When we halted and rolled the ringing guns out of the tower,
            ’twas for all the world like Friar Roger’s picture of the French siege in the Queen’s
            Missal-book.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And what did we—I mean, what did our village do?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh! Bore it nobly—nobly,’ cried Hal. ‘Though they had tricked me, I was proud of us.
            They came out of their housen, looked at that little army as though it had been a post,
            and went their shut-mouthed way. Never a sign! Never a word! They’d ha’ perished sooner
            than let Brightling overcrow us. Even that villain, Ticehurst Will, coming out of the
            Bell for his morning ale, he all but ran under Sir John’s horse. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Ware, Sirrah Devil!” cries Sir John, reining back. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Oh!” says Will. “Market day, is it? And all the bullocks from Brightling here?”</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But John Collins was our masterpiece! He happened along-street (his jaw tied up where
            Sebastian had clouted him) when we were trundling the first demi-cannon through the
            lych-gate. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“I reckon you’ll find her middlin’ heavy,” he says. “If you’ve a mind to pay, I’ll
            loan ye my timber-tug. She won’t lie easy on <span class="tei tei-sic">ary</span> wool-wain.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That was the one time I ever saw Sebastian taken flat aback. He opened and shut his
            mouth, fishy-like. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“No offence,” says Master John. “You’ve got her reasonable good cheap. I thought ye
            might not grudge me a groat if I help move her.” Ah, he was a masterpiece! They say that
            morning’s work cost our John two hundred pounds, and he never winked an eyelid, not even
            when he saw the guns all carted off to Lewes.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Neither then nor later?’ said Puck. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Once. ’Twas after he gave St. Barnabas the new chime of bells. (Oh, there was nothing
            the Collinses, or the Hayes, or the Fowles, or the Fanners would not do for the church
            then! “Ask and have” was their song.) We had rung ’em in, and he was in the tower with
            Black Nick Fowle, that gave us our rood-screen. The old man pinches the bell-rope one
            hand and scratches his neck with t’other. “Sooner she was pulling yon clapper than my
            neck,” he says. That was all! That was Sussex—seely Sussex for everlastin’!’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I went back into England,’ said Hal, slowly. ‘I’d had my lesson against pride. But
            they tell me I left St. Barnabas’s a jewel—just about a jewel! Wel-a-well! ’Twas done
            for and among my own people, and—Father Roger was right—I never knew such trouble or
            such triumph since. That’s the nature o’ things. A dear—dear land.’ He dropped his chin
            on his chest. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There’s your Father at the Forge. What’s he talking to old Hobden about?’ said Puck,
            opening his hand with three leaves in it. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan looked towards the cottage. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, I know. It’s that old oak lying across the brook. Pater always wants it grubbed.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the still valley they could hear old Hobden’s deep tones. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Have it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></span> you’ve a mind to,’ he was saying. ‘But the vivers
            of her roots they hold the bank together. If you grub her out, the bank she’ll all come
            tearin’ down, an’ next floods the brook’ll swarve up. But have it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></span> you’ve a mind. The mistuss she sets a heap by the ferns on her trunk.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh! I’ll think it over,’ said the Pater. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Una laughed a little bubbling chuckle. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What Devil’s in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span> belfry?’ said Hal, with a lazy laugh.
            ‘That should be Hobden by his <span class="tei tei-corr">voice.’</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why, the oak is the regular bridge for all the rabbits between the Three Acre and our
            meadow. The best place for wires on the farm, Hobden says. He’s got two there now,’ <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Una answered. ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></span> won’t ever let

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ah, Sussex! Silly Sussex for everlastin’,’ murmured Hal; and the next moment their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Just at dusk, a soft September rain began to fall on the hop-pickers. The mothers
            wheeled the bouncing perambulators out of the gardens; bins were put away, and
            tally-books made up. The young couples strolled home, two to each umbrella, and the
            single men walked behind them laughing. Dan and Una, who had been picking after their
            lessons, marched off to roast potatoes at the oast-house, where old Hobden, with
            Blue-eyed Bess, his lurcher-dog, lived all the month through, drying the hops. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They settled themselves, as usual, on the sack-strewn cot in front of the fires, and,
            when Hobden drew up the shutter, stared, as usual, at the flameless bed of coals
            spouting its heat up the dark well of the old-fashioned roundel. Slowly he cracked off a
            few fresh pieces of coal, packed them, with fingers that never flinched, exactly where
            they would do most good; slowly he reached behind him till Dan tilted the potatoes into
            his iron scoop of a hand; carefully he arranged them round the fire, and then stood for
            a moment, black against the glare. As he closed the shutter, the oast-house seemed dark
            before the day’s end, and he lit the candle in the lanthorn. The children liked all
            these things because they knew them so well. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Bee Boy, Hobden’s son, who is not quite right in his head, though he can do
            anything with bees, slipped in like a shadow. They only guessed it when Bess’s
            stump-tail wagged against them. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A big voice began singing outside in the drizzle:— </p>

          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There can’t be two people made to holler like that!’ cried old Hobden, wheeling
            round. </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A man showed at the doorway. </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘You’re a hem of a time makin’ your mind to it, Ralph!’ The stranger strode in—three
            full inches taller than Hobden, a grey-whiskered, brown-faced giant with clear blue
            eyes. They shook hands, and the children could hear the hard palms rasp together. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘You ain’t lost none o’ your grip,’ said Hobden. ‘Was it thirty or forty year back you
            broke my head at Peasmarsh Fair?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Only thirty, an’ no odds ’tween us regardin’ heads, neither. You had it back at me
            with a hop-pole. How did we get home that night? Swimmin’?’ </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Same way the pheasant come into Gubbs’s pocket—by a little luck an’ a deal o’ <span class="tei tei-corr">conjurin’.’</span> Old Hobden laughed in his deep chest. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I see you’ve not forgot your way about the woods. D’ye do any o’ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></span> still?’ The stranger pretended to look along a gun. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hobden answered with a quick movement of the hand as though he were pegging down a
            rabbit-wire. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That’s</span></span> all that’s left me now. Age she must as Age she
            can. An’ what’s your news since all these years?’ </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">‘Oh, I’ve bin to Plymouth, I’ve bin to Dover—</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">I’ve bin ramblin’, boys, the wide world over,’</div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> the man answered cheerily. ‘I reckon I know as much of Old England as most.’ He turned
            towards the children and winked boldly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I lay they told you a sight o’ lies, then. I’ve been into England fur as Wiltsheer
            once. I was cheated proper over a pair of hedging-gloves,’ said Hobden. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There’s fancy-talkin’ everywhere. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You’ve</span></span> cleaved to your own
            parts pretty middlin’ close, Ralph.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Can’t shift an old tree ’thout it dyin’,’ Hobden chuckled. ‘An’ I be no more anxious
            to die than you look to be to help me with my hops to-night.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The great man leaned against the brickwork of the roundel, and swung his arms abroad.
            ‘Hire me!’ was all he said, and they stumped upstairs laughing. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span>
          <a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The children heard their shovels rasp on the cloth where the yellow hops lie drying
            above the fires, and all the oast-house filled with the sweet, sleepy smell as they were
            turned. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Who is it?’ Una whispered to the Bee Boy. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Dunno, no more’n you—if <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> dunno,’ said he, and smiled. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The voices on the drying-floor talked and chuckled together, and the heavy footsteps
            went back and forth. Presently a hop-pocket dropped through the press-hole overhead, and
            stiffened and fattened as they shovelled it full. ‘Clank!’ went the press, and rammed
            the loose stuff into tight cake. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Gently!’ they heard Hobden cry. ‘You’ll bust her crop if you lay on so. You be as
            careless as Gleason’s bull, Tom. Come an’ sit by the fires. She’ll do now.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They came down, and as Hobden opened the shutter to see if the potatoes were done Tom
            Shoesmith said to the children, ‘Put a plenty salt on ’em. That’ll show you the sort o’
            man <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> be.’ Again he winked, and again the Bee Boy laughed and Una
            stared at Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> know what sort o’ man you be,’ old Hobden grunted, groping
            for the potatoes round the fire. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Do ye?’ Tom went on behind his back. ‘Some of us can’t abide Horseshoes, or Church
            Bells, or Running Water; an’, talkin’ o’ runnin’ water’—he turned to Hobden, who was
            backing out of the roundel—‘d’you mind <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the great
            floods at Robertsbridge, when the miller’s man was drowned in the street?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Middlin’ well.’ Old Hobden let himself down on the coals by the fire door. ‘I was
            courtin’ my woman on the Marsh that year. Carter to Mus’ Plum I was—gettin’ ten
            shillin’s week. Mine was a Marsh woman.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Won’erful odd-gates place—Romney Marsh,’ said Tom Shoesmith. ‘I’ve heard say the
            world’s divided like into Europe, Ashy, Afriky, Ameriky, Australy, an’ Romney Marsh.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The Marsh folk think so,’ said Hobden. ‘I had a hem o’ trouble to get my woman to
            leave it.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Where did she come out of? I’ve forgot, Ralph.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <span class="tei tei-corr">‘Dymchurch</span> under the Wall,’ Hobden answered, a potato in
            his hand. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then she’d be a Pett—or a Whitgift, would she?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Whitgift.’ Hobden broke open the potato and ate it with the curious neatness of men
            who make most of their meals in the blowy open. ‘She growed to be quite reasonable-like
            after livin’ in the Weald awhile, but our first twenty year or two she was
            odd-fashioned, no bounds. And she was a won’erful hand with bees.’ He cut away a little
            piece of potato and threw it out to the door. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ah! I’ve heard say the Whitgifts could see further through a millstone than most,’
            said Shoesmith. ‘Did she, now?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘She was honest-innocent, of any nigro<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mancin’,’ said
            Hobden. ‘Only she’d read signs and sinnifications out o’ birds flyin’, stars fallin’,
            bees hivin’, and such. An’ she’d lie awake—listenin’ for calls, she said.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That don’t prove naught,’ said Tom. ‘All Marsh folk has been smugglers since time
            everlastin’. ’Twould be in her blood to listen out o’ nights.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nature-ally,’ old Hobden replied, smiling. ‘I mind when there was smugglin’ a sight
            nearer us than the Marsh be. But that wasn’t my woman’s trouble. ’Twas a passel o’
            no-sense talk,’ he dropped his voice, ‘about Pharisees.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes. I’ve heard Marsh men beleft in ’em.’ Tom looked straight at the wide-eyed
            children beside Bess. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Pharisees,’ cried Una. ‘Fairies? Oh, I see!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘People o’ the Hills,’ said the Bee Boy, throwing half of his potato towards the door. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There you be!’ said Hobden, pointing at him. ‘My boy, he has her eyes and her
            out-gate senses. That’s what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">she</span></span> called ’em!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And what did you think of it all?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Um—um,’ Hobden rumbled. ‘A man that uses fields an’ shaws after dark as much as I’ve
            done, he don’t go out of his road excep’ for keepers.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But settin’ that aside?’ said Tom, coaxingly. ‘I saw ye throw the Good Piece out-at
            doors just now. Do ye believe or—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> ye?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There was a great black eye to that tater,’ said Hobden, indignantly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘My liddle eye didn’t see un, then. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>looked as if
            you meant it for—for Any One that might need it. But settin’ that aside. D’ye believe
              or—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> ye?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I ain’t sayin’ <span class="tei tei-corr">nothin’,</span> because I’ve heard naught, an’ I’ve seen naught. But if you
            was to say there was more things after dark in the shaws than men, or fur, or feather,
            or fin, I dunno as I’d go farabout to call you a liar. Now turn again, Tom. What’s your
            say?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’m like you. I say nothin’. But I’ll tell you a tale, an’ you can fit it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></span> how you please.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Passel o’ no-sense stuff,’ growled Hobden, but he filled his pipe. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The Marsh men they call it Dymchurch Flit,’ Tom went on slowly. ‘Hap you’ve heard
            it?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘My woman she’ve told it me scores o’ times. Dunno as I didn’t end by belieft in’
            it—sometimes.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hobden crossed over as he spoke, and sucked with his pipe at the yellow
            lanthorn-flame. Tom rested one great elbow on one great knee, where he sat among the
            coal. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Have you ever bin in the Marsh?’ he said to Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Only as far as Rye, once,’ Dan answered. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ah, that’s but the edge. Back behind of her there’s steeples settin’ beside churches,
            an’ wise women settin’ beside their doors, an’ the sea settin’ above the land, an’ ducks
            herdin’ wild in the diks’ (he meant ditches). ‘The Marsh is justabout riddled with diks
            an’ sluices, an’ tide-gates an’ water-lets. You can hear em’ bubblin’ an’ grummelin’
            when the tide works in em’, an’ then you hear the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sea
            rangin’ left and right-handed all up along the Wall. You’ve seen how flat she is—the
            Marsh? You’d think nothin’ easier than to walk eend-on acrost her? Ah, but the diks an’
            the water-lets, they twists the roads about as ravelly as witch-yarn on the spindles. So
            ye get all turned round in broad daylight.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That’s because they’ve dreened the waters into the diks,’ said Hobden. ‘When I
            courted my woman the rushes was green—Eh me! the rushes was green—an’ the Bailiff o’
            the Marshes, he rode up and down as free as the fog.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Who was he?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why, the Marsh fever an’ ague. He’ve clapped me on the <span class="tei tei-corr">shoulder</span> once or twice till I
            shook proper. But now the dreenin’ off of the waters have done away with the fevers; so
            they make a joke, like, that the Bailiff o’ the Marshes broke his neck in a dik. A
            won’erful place for bees an’ ducks ’tis too.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘An’ old!’ Tom went on. ‘Flesh an’ Blood have been there since Time Everlastin’
            Beyond. Well, now, speakin’ among themselves, the Marshmen say that from Time
            Everlastin’ Beyond the Pharisees favoured the Marsh above the rest of Old England. I lay
            the Marshmen ought to know. They’ve been out after dark, father an’ son, smugglin’ some
            one thing or t’other, since ever wool grew to sheep’s backs. They say there was always a
            middlin’ few Pharisees to be seen on the Marsh. Impident as rabbits, they was. They’d
            dance on the nakid roads in the nakid daytime; they’d flash their liddle green lights
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>along the diks, comin’ an’ goin’, like honest
            smugglers. Yes, an’ times they’d lock the church doors against parson an’ clerk of
            Sundays!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘That ’ud be smugglers layin’ in the lace or the brandy till they could run it out o’
            the Marsh. I’ve told my woman so,’ said Hobden. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’ll lay she didn’t beleft it, then—not if she was a Whitgift. A won’erful choice
            place for Pharisees, the Marsh, by all accounts, till Queen Bess’s father he come in
            with his Reformatories.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Would that be a Act o’ Parliament like?’ Hobden asked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Sure-ly! ’Can’t do nothing in Old England without Act, Warrant, an’ Summons. He got
            his Act allowed him, an’, they say, Queen Bess’s father he used the parish churches
            something shameful. Justabout tore the gizzards out of I dunnamany. Some folk in England
            they held with ’en; but some they saw it different, an’ it eended in ’em takin’ sides
            an’ burnin’ each other no bounds, accordin’ which side was top, <span class="tei tei-corr">time bein’.</span> That
            tarrified the Pharisees: for Goodwill among Flesh an’ Blood is meat an’ drink to ’em,
            an’ ill-will is poison.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Same as bees,’ said the Bee Boy. ‘Bees won’t stay by a house where there’s hating.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘True,’ said Tom. ‘This Reformations tarrified the Pharisees same as the reaper goin’
            round a last stand o’ wheat tarrifies rabbits. They packed into the Marsh from all
            parts, and they says, “Fair or foul, we must flit out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>o’ this, for Merry England’s done with, an’ we’re reckoned among the Images.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Did they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></span> see it that way?’ said Hobden. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘All but one that was called Robin—if you’ve heard of him. What are you laughing at?’
            Tom turned to Dan. ‘The Pharisees’s trouble didn’t tech Robin, because he’d cleaved
            middlin’ close to people like. No more he never meant to go out of Old England—not he;
            so he was sent messagin’ for help among Flesh an’ Blood. But Flesh an’ Blood must always
            think of their own concerns, an’ Robin couldn’t get <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></span> at
            ’em, ye see. They thought it was tide-echoes off the Marsh.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What did you—what did the fai—Pharisees want?’ Una asked. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A boat to be sure. Their liddle wings could no more cross Channel than so many tired
            butterflies. A boat an’ a crew they desired to sail ’em over to France, where yet awhile
            folks hadn’t tore down the Images. They couldn’t abide cruel Canterbury Bells ringin’ to
            Bulverhithe for more pore men an’ women to be burnded, nor the King’s proud messenger
            ridin’ through the land givin’ orders to tear down the Images. They couldn’t abide it no
            shape. Nor yet they couldn’t get their boat an’ crew to flit by without Leave an’
            Good-will from Flesh an’ Blood; an’ Flesh an’ Blood came an’ went about its own business
            the while the Marsh was swarvin’ up, an’ swarvin’ up with Pharisees from all England
            over, striving all means <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to get <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></span> at Flesh an’ Blood to tell ’en their sore need.... I don’t know as
            you’ve ever heard say Pharisees are like chickens?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘My woman used to say that too,’ said Hobden, folding his brown arms. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They be. You run too many chickens together, an’ the ground sickens like, an’ you get
            a squat, an’ your chickens die. ’Same way, you crowd Pharisees all in one place—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></span> don’t die, but Flesh an’ Blood walkin’ among ’em is apt to
            sick up an’ pine off. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></span> don’t mean it, an’ Flesh an’ Blood
            don’t know it, but that’s the truth—as I’ve heard. The Pharisees through bein’ all
            stenched up an’ frighted, an’ tryin’ to come <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></span> with their
            supplications, they nature-ally changed the thin airs and humours in Flesh an’ Blood. It
            lay on the Marsh like thunder. Men saw their churches ablaze with the wildfire in the
            windows after dark; they saw their cattle scatterin’ and no man scarin’; their sheep
            flockin’ and no man drivin’; their horses latherin’ an’ no man leadin’; they saw the
            liddle low green lights more than ever in the dik-sides; they heard the liddle feet
            patterin’ more than ever round the houses; an’ night an’ day, day an’ night, ’twas all
            as though they were bein’ creeped up on, and hinted at by some One or Other that
            couldn’t rightly shape their trouble. Oh, I lay they sweated! Man an’ maid, woman an’
            child, their Nature done ’em no service all the weeks while the Marsh was swarvin’ up
            with Pharisees. But they was Flesh an’ Blood, an’ Marsh men before all. They reckoned
            the signs sinnified <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trouble for the Marsh. Or that the
            sea ’ud rear up against Dymchurch Wall an’ they’d be drownded like Old Winchelsea; or
            that the Plague was comin’. So they looked for the meanin’ in the sea or in the
            clouds—far an’ high up. They never thought to look near an’ knee-high, where they could
            see naught. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Now there was a poor widow at Dymchurch under the Wall, which, lacking man or
            property, she had the more time for feeling; and she come to feel there was a Trouble
            outside her doorstep bigger an’ heavier than aught she’d ever carried over it. She had
            two sons—one born blind, and t’other struck dumb through fallin’ off the Wall when he
            was liddle. They was men grown, but not wage-earnin’, an’ she worked for ’em, keepin’
            bees and answerin’ Questions.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What sort of questions?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Like where lost things might be found, an’ what to put about a crooked baby’s neck,
            an’ how to join parted sweethearts. She felt the Trouble on the Marsh same as eels feel

            up her mind. The Pharisees all about they hushed their children from cryin’ an’ they
            waited dumb-still. She was all their dependence. ’Thout her Leave an’ Goodwill they
            could not pass; for she was the Mother. So she shook like a asp-tree makin’ up her mind.
            ’Last she drives the word past her teeth, an’ “Go!” she says. “Go with my Leave an’
            Goodwill.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Then I saw—then, they say, she had to brace back same as if she was wadin’ in
            tide-water; for the Pharisees justabout flowed past her—down the beach to the boat, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> dunnamany of ’em—with their wives an’ children an’ valooables,
            all escapin’ out of cruel Old England. Silver you could hear clinkin’, an’ liddle
            bundles hove down dunt on the bottom-boards, an’ passels o’ liddle swords an’ shield’s
            raklin’, an’ liddle fingers an’ toes scratchin’ on the boatside to board her when the
            two sons pushed her off. That boat she sunk lower an’ lower, but all the Widow could see
            in it was her boys movin’ hampered-like to get at the tackle. Up sail they did, an’ away
            they went, deep as a Rye barge, away into the off-shore mistes, an’ the Widow Whitgift
            she sat down and eased her grief till mornin’ light.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I never heard she was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></span> alone,’ said Hobden. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I remember now. The one called Robin <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he stayed with
            her, they tell. She was all too grievious to listen to his promises.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Ah! She should ha’ made her bargain beforehand. I allus told my woman so!’ Hobden
            cried. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No. She loaned her sons for a pure love-loan, bein’ as she sensed the Trouble on the
            Marshes, an’ was simple good-willing to ease it.’ Tom laughed softly. ‘She done that.
            Yes, she done that! From Hithe to Bulverthithe, fretty man an’ petty maid, ailin’ woman
            an’ wailin’ child, they took the advantage of the change in the thin airs just about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></span> soon as the Pharisees flitted. Folks come out fresh an’ shining
            all over the Marsh like snails after wet. An’ that while the Widow Whitgift sat grievin’
            on the Wall. She might have beleft us—she might have trusted her sons would be sent
            back! She fussed, no bounds, when their boat come in after three days.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And, of course, the sons were both quite cured?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No-o. That would have been out o’ Nature. She got ’em back <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as</span></span>
            she sent ’em. The blind man he hadn’t seen naught of anything, an’ the dumb man
            nature-ally, he couldn’t say aught of what he’d seen. I reckon that was why the
            Pharisees pitched on ’em for the ferrying job.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But what did you—what did <span class="tei tei-corr">Robin</span> promise the Widow?’ said Dan. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></span> he promise, now?’ Tom pretended to think. ‘Wasn’t
            your woman a Whitgift, Ralph? Didn’t she say?’ </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span>
          <a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘She told me a passel o’ no-sense stuff when he was born.’ Hobden pointed at his son.
            ‘There was always to be one of ’em that could see further into a millstone than most.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Me! That’s me!’ said the Bee Boy so suddenly that they all laughed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’ve got it now!’ cried Tom, slapping his knee. ‘So long as Whitgift blood lasted,
            Robin promised there would allers be one o’ her stock that—that no Trouble ’ud lie on,
            no Maid ’ud sigh on, no Night could frighten, no Fright could harm, no Harm could make
            sin, an’ no Woman could make a fool.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Well, ain’t that just me?’ said the Bee Boy, where he sat in the silver square of the
            great September moon that was staring into the oast-house door. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘They was the exact words she told me when we first found he wasn’t like others. But
            it beats me how you known ’em,’ said Hobden. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Aha! There’s more under my hat besides hair!’ Tom laughed and stretched himself.
            ‘When I’ve seen these two young folk home, we’ll make a night of old days, Ralph, with
            passin’ old tales—eh? An’ where might you live?’ he said, gravely, to Dan. ‘An’ do you
            think your Pa ’ud give me a drink for takin’ you there, Missy?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They giggled so at this that they had to run out. Tom picked them both up, set one on
            each broad shoulder, and tramped across the ferny pasture where the cows puffed milky
            puffs at them in the moonlight. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, Puck! Puck! I guessed you right <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from when you
            talked about the salt. How could you ever do it?’ Una cried, swinging along delighted. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Do what?’ he said, and climbed the stile by the pollard oak. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Pretend to be Tom Shoesmith,’ said Dan, and they ducked to avoid the two little ashes
            that grow by the bridge over the brook. Tom was almost running. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes. That’s my name, Mus’ Dan,’ he said, hurrying over the silent shining lawn, where
            a rabbit sat by the big white-thorn near the croquet ground. ‘Here you be.’ He strode
            into the old kitchen yard, and slid them down as Ellen came to ask questions. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I’m helping in Mus’ Spray’s oast-house,’ he said to her. ‘No, I’m no foreigner. I
            knowed this country ’fore your Mother was born; an’—yes it’s dry work oasting, Miss.
            Thank you.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Ellen went to get a jug, and the children went in—magicked once more by Oak, Ash, and
            Thorn! </p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Now it was the third week in November, and the woods rang with the noise of
            pheasant-shooting. No one hunted that steep, cramped country except the village beagles,
            who, as often as not, escaped from their kennels and made a day of their own. Dan and
            Una found a couple of them towling round the kitchen-garden after the laundry cat. The
            little brutes were only too pleased to go rabbiting, so the children ran them all along
            the brook pastures and into Little Lindens farm-yard, where the old sow vanquished
            them—and up to the quarry-hole, where they started a fox. He headed for Far Wood, and
            there they frightened out all the pheasants who were sheltering from a big beat across
            the valley. Then the cruel guns began again, and they grabbed the beagles lest they
            should stray and get hurt. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I wouldn’t be a pheasant—in November—for a lot,’ Dan panted, as he caught <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Folly</span></span> by the neck. ‘Why did you laugh that horrid way?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I didn’t,’ said Una, sitting on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Flora</span></span>, the fat lady-dog. ‘Oh,
            look! The silly birds are going back to their own woods instead of ours, where they
            would be safe.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Safe till it pleased you to kill them.’ An old man, so tall he was almost a giant,
            stepped <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from behind the clump of hollies by
            ‘Volaterrae.’ The children jumped, and the dogs dropped like setters. He wore a sweeping
            gown of dark thick stuff, lined and edged with yellowish fur, and he bowed a bent-down
            bow that made them feel both proud and ashamed. Then he looked at them steadily, and
            they stared back without doubt or fear. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘You are not afraid?’ he said, running his hands through his splendid grey beard. ‘Not
            afraid that those men yonder’—he jerked his head towards the incessant pop-pop of the
            guns from the lower woods—‘will do you hurt?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘We-ell’—Dan liked to be accurate, especially when he was shy—‘old Hobd—a friend of
            mine told me that one of the beaters got peppered last week—hit in the leg, I mean. You
            see, Mr. Meyer <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></span> fire at rabbits. But he gave Waxy Garnett a
            quid—sovereign, I mean—and Waxy told Hobden he’d have stood both barrels for half the
            money.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘He doesn’t understand,’ Una cried, watching the pale, troubled face. ‘Oh, I wish——’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She had scarcely said it when Puck rustled out of the hollies and spoke to the man
            quickly in foreign words. Puck wore a long cloak too—the afternoon was just frosting
            down—and it changed his appearance altogether. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay, nay!’ he said at last. ‘You did not understand the boy. A freeman was a little
            hurt, by pure mischance, at the hunting.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I know that mischance! What did his Lord do? Laugh and ride over him?’ the old man
            sneered. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span>
          <a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘It was one of your own people did the hurt, Kadmiel.’ Puck’s eyes twinkled
            maliciously. ‘So he gave the freeman a piece of gold, and no more was said.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A Jew drew blood from a Christian and no more was said?’ Kadmiel cried. ‘Never! When
            did they torture him?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No man may be bound, or fined, or slain till he has been judged by his peers,’ Puck
            insisted. ‘There is but one Law in Old England for Jew or Christian—the Law that was
            signed at Runnymede.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why, that’s Magna Charta!’ Dan whispered. It was one of the few history dates that he
            could remember. Kadmiel turned on him with a sweep and a whirr of his spicy-scented
            gown. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Dost <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thou</span></span> know of that, babe?’ he cried, and lifted his hands
            in wonder. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yes,’ said Dan, firmly. </p>
          <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">‘Magna Charta was signed by John,</div>
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">That Henry the Third put his heel upon.</div>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And old Hobden says that if it hadn’t been for her (he calls everything “her,” you
            know), the keepers would have him clapped in Lewes Gaol all the year round.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again Puck translated to Kadmiel in the strange, solemn-sounding language, and at last
            Kadmiel laughed. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Out of the mouths of babes do we learn,’ said he. ‘But tell me now, and I will not
            call you a babe but a Rabbi, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></span> did the King sign the roll of
            the New Law at Runnymede? For he was a King.’ </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span>
          <a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dan looked sideways at his sister. It was her turn. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Because he jolly well had to,’ <span class="tei tei-corr">said</span> Una, softly. ‘The Barons
            made him.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay,’ Kadmiel answered, shaking his head. ‘You Christians always forget that gold
            does more than the sword. Our good King signed because he could not borrow more money
            from us bad Jews.’ He curved his shoulders as he spoke. ‘A King without gold is a snake
            with a broken back, and’—his nose sneered up and his eyebrows frowned down—‘it is a
            good deed to break a snake’s back. That was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></span> work,’ he cried,
            triumphantly, to Puck. ‘Spirit of Earth, bear witness that that was my work!’ He shot up
            to his full towering height, and his words rang like a trumpet. He had a voice that
            changed its tone almost as an opal changes colour—sometimes deep and thundery,
            sometimes thin and waily, but always it made you listen. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Many people can bear witness to that,’ Puck answered. ‘Tell these babes how it was
            done. Remember, Master, they do not know Doubt or Fear.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So I saw in their faces when we met,’ said Kadmiel. ‘Yet surely, surely they are
            taught to spit upon Jews?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Are they?’ said Dan, much interested. ‘Where at?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Puck fell back a pace, laughing. ‘Kadmiel is thinking of King John’s reign,’ he
            explained. ‘His people were badly treated then.’ </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span>
          <a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, we know <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>,’ they answered, and (it was very rude of
            them, but they could not help it) they stared straight at Kadmiel’s mouth to see if his
            teeth were all there. It stuck in their lesson-memory that King John used to pull out
            Jews’ teeth to make them lend him money. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Kadmiel understood the look and smiled bitterly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No. Your King never drew my teeth: I think, perhaps, I drew his. Listen! I was not
            born among Christians, but among Moors—in Spain—in a little white town under the
            mountains. Yes, the Moors are cruel, but at least their learned men dare to think. It
            was prophesied of me at my birth that I should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange
            speech and a hard language. We Jews are always looking for the Prince and the Lawgiver
            to come. Why not? My people in the town (we were very few) set me apart as a child of
            the prophecy—the Chosen of the Chosen. We Jews dream so many dreams. You would never
            guess it to see us slink about the rubbish-heaps in our quarter; but at the day’s
            end—doors shut, candles lit—aha! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></span> we become the Chosen
            again.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He paced back and forth through the wood as he talked. The rattle of the shot-guns
            never ceased, and the dogs whimpered a little and lay flat on the leaves. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I was a Prince. Yes! Think of a little Prince who had never known rough words in his
            own house handed over to shouting, bearded Rabbis, who pulled his ears and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>filliped his nose, all that he might learn—learn—learn to be
            King when his time came. Hé! Such a little Prince it was! One eye he kept on the
            stone-throwing Moorish boys, and the other it roved about the streets looking for his
            Kingdom. Yes, and he learned to cry softly when he was hunted up and down those streets.
            He learned to do all things without noise. He played beneath his father’s table when the
            Great Candle was lit, and he listened as children listen to the talk of his father’s
            friends above the table. They came across the mountains, from out of all the world; for
            my Prince’s father was their councillor. They came from behind the armies of
            Sala-ud-Din: from Rome: from Venice: from England. They stole down our alley, they
            tapped secretly at our door, they took off their rags, they arrayed themselves, and they
            talked to my father at the wine. All over the world the heathen fought each other. They
            brought news of these wars, and while he played beneath the table, my Prince heard these
            meanly-dressed ones decide between themselves how, and when, and for how long King
            should draw sword against King, and People rise up against People. Why not? There can be
            no war without gold, and we Jews know how the earth’s gold moves with the seasons, and
            the crops, and the winds; circling and looping and rising and sinking away like a
            river—a wonderful underground river. How should the foolish Kings know <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span> while they fight and steal and kill?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The children’s faces showed that they knew <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nothing at
            all as, with open eyes, they trotted and turned beside the long-striding old man. He
            twitched his gown over his shoulders, and a square plate of gold, studded with jewels,
            gleamed for an instant through the fur, like a star through flying snow. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘No matter,’ he said. ‘But, credit me, my Prince saw peace or war decided not once,
            but many times, by the fall of a coin spun between a Jew from Bury and a Jewess from
            Alexandria, in his father’s house, when the Great Candle was lit. Such power had we Jews
            among the Gentiles. Ah, my little Prince! Do you wonder that he learned quickly? Why
            not?’ He muttered to himself and went on:— </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘My trade was that of a physician. When I had learned it in Spain I went to the East
            to find my Kingdom. Why not? A Jew is as free as a sparrow—or a dog. He goes where he
            is hunted. In the East I found libraries where men dared to think—schools of medicine
            where they dared to learn. I was diligent in my business. Therefore I stood before
            Kings. I have been a brother to Princes and a companion to beggars, and I have walked
            between the living and the dead. There was no profit in it. I did not find my Kingdom.
            So, in the tenth year of my travels, when I had reached the Uttermost Eastern Sea, I
            returned to my father’s house. God had wonderfully preserved my people. None had been
            slain, none even wounded, and only a few scourged. I became once more a son in my
            father’s house.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span>
          <a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Again the Great Candle was lit; again the meanly-apparelled ones tapped on our door
            after dusk; and again I heard them weigh out peace and war, as they weighed out the gold
            on the table. But I was not rich—not very rich. Therefore, when those that had power
            and knowledge and wealth talked together, I sat in the shadow. Why not? </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Yet all my wanderings had shown me one sure thing, which is, that a King without
            money is like a spear without a head. He cannot do much harm. I said, therefore, to
            Elias of Bury, a great one among our people: “Why do our people lend any more to the
            Kings that oppress us?” “Because,” said Elias, “if we refuse they stir up their people
            against us, and the People are tenfold more cruel than Kings. If thou doubtest, come
            with me to Bury in England and live as I live.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I saw my mother’s face across the candle-flame, and I said, “I will come with thee
            to Bury. Maybe my Kingdom shall be there.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So I sailed with Elias to the darkness and the cruelty of Bury in England, where
            there are no learned men. How can a man be wise if he hate? At Bury I kept his accounts
            for Elias, and I saw men kill Jews there by the tower. No—none laid hands on Elias. He
            lent money to the King, and the King’s favour was about him. A King will not take the
            life so long as there is any gold. This King—yes, John—oppressed his people bitterly
            because they would not give him money. Yet his land was a good land. If he had only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>given it rest he might have cropped it as a Christian
            crops his beard. But even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span> little he did not know; for God
            had deprived him of all understanding, and had multiplied pestilence, and famine, and
            despair upon the people. Therefore his people turned against us Jews, who are all
            people’s dogs. Why not? Lastly the Barons and the people rose together against the King
            because of his cruelties. Nay—nay—the Barons did not love the people, but they saw
            that if the King eat up and destroyed the common people, he would presently destroy the
            Barons. They joined then, as cats and pigs will join to slay a snake. I kept the
            accounts, and I watched all these things, for I remembered the Prophecy. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A great gathering of Barons (to most of whom we had lent money) came to Bury, and
            there, after much talk and a thousand runnings-about, they made a roll of the New Laws
            that they would force on the King. If he swore to keep those Laws, they would allow him
            a little money. That was the King’s God—Money—to waste. They showed us the roll of the
            New Laws. Why not? We had lent them money. We knew all their counsels—we Jews shivering
            behind our doors in Bury.’ He threw out his hands suddenly. ‘We did not seek to be paid
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></span> in money. We sought Power—Power—Power! That is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></span> God in our captivity. Power to use! </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I said to Elias: “These New Laws are good. Lend no more money to the King: so long as
            he has money he will lie and slay the people.” </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span>
          <a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Nay,” said Elias. “I know this people. They are madly cruel. Better one King than a
            thousand butchers. I have lent a little money to the Barons, or they would torture us,
            but my most I will lend to the King. He hath promised me a place near him at Court,
            where my wife and I shall be safe.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“But if the King be made to keep these New Laws,” I said, “the land will have peace,
            and our trade will grow. If we lend he will fight again.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“Who made thee a Lawgiver in England?” said Elias. “I know this people. Let the dogs
            tear one another! I will lend the King ten thousand pieces of gold, and he can fight the
            Barons at his pleasure.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘“There are not two thousand pieces of gold in all England this summer,” I said, for I
            kept the accounts, and I knew how the earth’s gold moved—that wonderful underground
            river! Elias barred home the windows, and, his hands about his mouth, he told me how,
            when he was trading with small wares in a French ship, he had come to the Castle of
            Pevensey.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh!’ said Dan. ‘Pevensey again!’ and looked at Una, who nodded and skipped. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘There, after they had scattered his pack up and down the Great Hall, some young
            knights carried him to an upper room, and dropped him into a well in a wall, that rose
            and fell with the tide. They called him Joseph, and threw torches at his wet head. Why
            not?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why, of course,’ cried Dan. ‘Didn’t you know it was——’ Puck held up his hand to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stop him, and Kadmiel, who never noticed, went on. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When the tide dropped he thought he stood on old armour, but feeling with his toes,
            he raked up bar on bar of soft gold. Some wicked treasure of the old days put away, and
            the secret cut off by the sword. I have heard the like before.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So have we,’ Una whispered. ‘But it wasn’t wicked a bit.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Elias took a morsel of the stuff with him, and thrice yearly he would return to
            Pevensey as a chapman, selling at no price or profit, till they suffered him to sleep in
            the empty room, where he would plumb and grope, and steal away a few bars. The great
            store of it still remained, and by long brooding he had come to look on it as his own.
            Yet when we thought how we should lift and convey it, we saw no way. This was before the
            Word of the Lord had come to me. A walled fortress possessed by Normans; in the midst a
            forty-foot tide-well out of which to remove secretly many horse-loads of gold! Hopeless!
            So Elias wept. Adah, his wife, wept too. She had hoped to stand beside the Queen’s
            Christian tiring-maids at Court, when the King should give them that place at Court
            which he had promised. Why not? She was born in England—an odious woman. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘The present evil to us was that Elias, out of his strong folly, had, as it were,
            promised the King that he would arm him with more gold. Wherefore the King in his camp
            stopped his ears against the Barons and the people. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Wherefore men died daily. Adah so desired her place at Court, she besought Elias to
            tell the King where the treasure lay, that the King might take it by force, and—they
            would trust in his gratitude. Why not? This Elias refused to do, for he looked on the
            gold as his own. They quarrelled, and they wept at the evening meal, and late in the
            night came one Langton—a priest, almost learned—to borrow more money for the Barons.
            Elias and Adah went to their chamber.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Kadmiel laughed scornfully in his beard. The shots across the valley stopped as the
            shooting-party changed their ground for the last beat. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘So it was I, not Elias,’ he went on, quietly, ‘that made terms with Langton touching
            the fortieth of the New Laws.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘What terms?’ said Puck, quickly. ‘The Fortieth of the Great Charter say: “To none
            will we sell, refuse, or deny right or justice.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘True, but the Barons had written first: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">To no free man.</span></span> It
            cost me two hundred broad pieces of gold to change those narrow words. Langton, the
            priest, understood. “Jew though thou art,” said he, “the change is just, and if ever
            Christian and Jew come to be equal in England thy people may thank thee.” Then he went
            out stealthily, as men do who deal with Israel by night. I think he spent my gift upon
            his altar. Why not? I have spoken with Langton. He was such a man as I might have been
            if—if we Jews had been a people. But yet, in many things, a child. </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I heard Elias and Adah abovestairs quarrel, and, knowing the woman was the stronger,
            I saw that Elias would tell the King of the gold and that the King would continue in his
              <span class="tei tei-corr">stubbornness</span>. Therefore I saw that the gold must be put
            away from the reach of any man. Of a sudden, the Word of the Lord came to me saying,
            “The Morning is come, O thou that dwellest in the land.”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Kadmiel halted, all black against the pale green sky beyond the wood—a huge robed
            figure, like the Moses in the picture-Bible. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I rose. I went out, and as I shut the door on that House of Foolishness, the woman
            looked from the window and whispered, “I have prevailed on my husband to tell the King!”
            I answered, “There is no need. The Lord is with me.” </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘In that hour the Lord gave me full understanding of all that I must do; and His Hand
            covered me in my ways. First I went to London, to a physician of our people, who sold me
            certain drugs that I needed. You shall see why. Thence I went swiftly to Pevensey. Men
            fought all around me, for there were neither rulers nor judges in the abominable land.
            Yet when I walked by them they cried out that I was one Ahasuerus, a Jew, condemned, as
            they believe, to live for ever, and they fled from me everyways. Thus the Lord saved me
            for my work, and at Pevensey I bought me a little boat and moored it on the mud beneath
            the Marsh-gate of the Castle. That also God showed me.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was as calm as though he were speaking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of some
            stranger, and his voice filled the little bare wood with rolling music. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I cast’—his hand went to his breast, and again the strange jewel gleamed—‘I cast
            the drugs which I had prepared into the common well of the Castle. Nay, I did no harm.
            The more we physicians know, the less do we do. Only the fool says: “I dare.” I caused a
            blotched and itching rash to break out upon their skins, but I knew it would fade in
            fifteen days. I did not stretch out my hand against their life. They in the Castle
            thought it was the Plague, and they ran forth, taking with them their very dogs. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘A Christian physician, seeing that I was a Jew and a stranger, vowed that I had
            brought the sickness from London. This is the one time I have ever heard a Christian
            leech speak truth of any disease. Thereupon the people beat me, but a merciful woman
            said: “Do not kill him now. Push him into our Castle with his plague, and if, as he
            says, it will abate on the fifteenth day, we can kill him then.” Why not? They drove me
            across the drawbridge of the Castle, and fled back to their booths. Thus I came to be
            alone with the treasure.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But did you know this was all going to happen just right?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘My Prophecy was that I should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange land and a hard
            speech. I knew I should not die. I washed my cuts. I found the tide-well in the wall,
            and from Sabbath to Sabbath I dove and dug there in that empty, Christian-smelling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fortress. Hé! I spoiled the Egyptians! Hé! If they had
            only known! I drew up many good loads of gold, which I loaded by night into my boat.
            There had been gold-dust too, but that had been washed away by the tides.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Didn’t you ever wonder who had put it there?’ said Dan, stealing a glance at Puck’s
            calm, dark face under the hood of his gown. Puck shook his head and pursed his lips. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Often; for the gold was new to me,’ Kadmiel replied. ‘I know the Golds. I can judge
            them in the dark; but this was heavier and redder than any we deal in. Perhaps it was
            the very gold of Parvaim. Eh, why not? It went to my heart to heave it on to the mud,
            but I saw well that if the evil thing remained, or if even the hope of finding it
            remained, the King would not sign the New Laws, and the land would perish.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Oh, Marvel!’ said Puck, beneath his breath, rustling in the dead leaves. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘When the boat was loaded I washed my hands seven times, and pared beneath my nails,
            for I would not keep one grain. I went out by the little gate where the Castle’s refuse
            is thrown. I dared not hoist sail lest men should see me; but the Lord commanded the
            tide to bear me carefully, and I was far from land before the morning.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Weren’t you afraid?’ said Una. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Why? There were no Christians in the boat. At sunrise I made my prayer, and cast the
            gold—all—all that gold into the deep sea! A King’s ransom—no, the ransom of a People!
            When I had loosed hold of the last <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bars, the Lord
            commanded the tide to return me to a haven at the mouth of a river, and thence I walked
            across a wilderness to Lewes, where I have brethren. They opened the door to me, and
            they say—I had not eaten for two days—they say that I fell across the threshold,
            crying, “I have sunk an army with horsemen in the sea!”’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But you hadn’t,’ said Una. ‘Oh, yes! I see! You meant that King John might have spent
            it on that?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Even so,’ said Kadmiel. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The firing broke out again close behind them. The pheasants poured over the top of a
            belt of tall firs. They could see young Mr. Meyer, in his new yellow gaiters, very busy
            and excited at the end of the line, and they could hear the thud of the falling birds. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘But what did Elias of Bury do?’ Puck demanded. ‘He had promised money to the King.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Kadmiel smiled grimly. ‘I sent him word from London that the Lord was on my side. When
            he heard that the Plague had broken out in Pevensey, and that a Jew had been thrust into
            the Castle to cure it, he understood my word was true. He and Adah hurried to Lewes and
            asked me for an accounting. He still looked on the gold as his own. I told them where I
            had laid it, and I gave them full leave to pick it up.... Eh, well! The curses of a fool
            and the dust of a journey are two things no wise man can escape.... But I pitied Elias!
            The King was wroth at him because he could not lend; the Barons <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were wroth at him because they heard that he would have lent to the King;
            and Adah was wroth at him because she was an odious woman. They took ship from Lewes to
            Spain. That was wise!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘And you? Did you see the signing of the Law at Runnymede?’ said Puck, as Kadmiel
            laughed noiselessly. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Nay. Who am I to meddle with things too high for me? I returned to Bury, and lent
            money on the autumn crops. Why not?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was a crackle overhead. A cock-pheasant that had sheered aside after being hit
            spattered down almost on top of them, driving up the dry leaves like a shell. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Flora</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Folly</span></span> threw themselves at it; the
            children rushed forward, and when they had beaten them off and smoothed down the plumage
            Kadmiel had disappeared. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Well,’ said Puck, calmly, ‘what did you think of it? Weland gave the Sword. The Sword
            gave the Treasure, and the Treasure gave the Law. It’s as natural as an oak growing.’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘I don’t understand. Didn’t he know it was Sir Richard’s old treasure?’ said Dan. ‘And
            why did Sir Richard and Brother Hugh leave it lying about? And—and——’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Never mind,’ said Una, politely. ‘He’ll let us come and go, and look, and know
            another time. Won’t you, Puck?’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Another time maybe,’ Puck answered. ‘Brr! It’s cold—and late. I’ll race you towards
            home!’ </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They hurried down into the sheltered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>valley. The sun
            had almost sunk behind Cherry Clack, the trodden ground by the cattle-gates was freezing
            at the edges, and the new-waked north wind blew the night on them from over the hills.
            They picked up their feet and flew across the browned pastures, and when they halted,
            panting in the steam of their own breath, the dead leaves whirled up behind them. There
            was Oak and Ash and Thorn enough in that year-end shower to magic away a thousand
            memories. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So they trotted to the brook at the bottom of the lawn, wondering why <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Flora</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Folly</span></span> had missed the quarry-hole
            fox. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Old Hobden was just finishing some hedge-work. They saw his white smock glimmer in the
            twilight where he faggoted the rubbish. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Winter, he’s come, I rackon, Mus’ Dan,’ he called. ‘Hard times now till Heffle Cuckoo
            Fair. Yes, we’ll all be glad to see the Old Woman let the Cuckoo out o’ the basket for
            to start lawful Spring in England.’ They heard a crash, and a stamp and a splash of
            water as though a heavy old cow were crossing almost under their noses. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hobden ran forward angrily to the ford. </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> ‘Gleason’s bull again, playin’ Robin all over the Farm! Oh, look, Mus’ Dan—his great

            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
